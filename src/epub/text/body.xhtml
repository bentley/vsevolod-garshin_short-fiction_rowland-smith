THE FROG WHO TRAVELLED

Once upon a time there lived in this world a frog. She
used to sit in a swamp and catch mosquitoes and midges,
and in the spring used to croak loudly in company with
her friends. And but for an event which occurred she
would have lived happily her whole life through — -pro-
vided, of course, a stork had not eaten her.

One day she was sitting on a crooked branch which
stuck out of the water, and was revelling in a warm, slight
drizzling rain.

" Ah me, what beautiful damp weather to-day !" she
thought. " What a delight it is to live !"

The drizzle damped her striped polished back, and the
raindrops trickled down under her belly behind her paws,
which was extraordinarily pleasant — so pleasant that she
almost gave a croak. But luckily she remembered that
it was already autumn, and that frogs don't croak in the
autumn — the spring is the time for that — and had she
croaked she might have lost her '' frogly " dignity. So
she kept quiet and continued to take her ease.

Suddenly a thin, intermittent, whistling noise resounded
in the air.

There is a species of duck which, when it flies, makes
a singing, or rather a whistling, sound with its wings as
they cleave the air. " Phew, phew, phew, phew !" sounds
through the air when a covey of such ducks fly high
above us, although the birds themselves are invisible, so

270



THE FROG WHO TRAVELLED 271

high do they fly. On this occasion the ducks, having
described an enormous semicircle, swooped down and
settled in the very same swamp in which the frog lived.

" Quack, quack !" said one of them. " We have still
a long way to fly ; we must have something to eat."

And the frog instantly hid herself, and, although she
knew that the ducks would not eat her — a big and fat
frog — she all the same dived under the log in case of
accidents. However, having thought it over, she decided
to stick her head with its protruding eyes out of the
w^ater. She was very curious to know to where the ducks
were flying.

" Quack, quack !" said another duck. " It is already
quite cold. Let us get away as quickly as possible to
the South."

And all the ducks began to quack loudly in token of
their approval.

*' Mesdames ducks," said the frog, plucking up her
courage, " what is the * South ' to which you are flying ?
Please excuse me for disturbing you."

The ducks crowded round the frog. At first they
evinced a decided inclination to eat her, but each on
reflection came to the conclusion that she was too big
to be swallowed. And then they all began to quack and
flap their wings.

** It is very nice in the South ! It is warm there now !
And what lovely warm swamps there are there ! What
worms ! It is nice in the South !"

They quacked to such a degree that they nearly
deafened the frog. She could scarcely prevail on them
to be quiet, and begged one of them, who seemed to her
the fattest and most intelligent of them all, to explain
to her what was the " South." And when the duck told
her all about the South, the frog went into ecstasies, but;
nevertheless, at the end of the description, because she
was a cautious frog, she asked him :

" And are there midges and mosquitoes there ?"



272 THE FROG WHO TRAVELLED

" Oh, I should just say so — clouds of them !" replied
the duck .

*' Croak !" said the frog, and immediately turned round
to see if there was any friend near who could have heard
her and scolded her for croaking in the autumn. She really
could not restrain herself from giving at least one little
croak. ** Take me with you !"

" You astonish me !" exclaimed the duck. " How can
we take you ? You have no wings !"

" When do you fl}^ ?" asked the frog.

" Soon, soon !" cried out all the ducks. '' Quack,
quack, quack ! Here it is cold ! To the South ! to the
South !"

" Allow me to think only five minutes," said the frog.
" I will come back directly. I am sure to think of some-
thing good."

And she flopped from the branch, on to which she had
again clambered, into the water, dived into the mud, and
absolutely buried herself in it, so that no extraneous
matter should distract her thoughts. Five minutes
passed, and the ducks had all collected to fly, when
suddenly from out of the water near the branch on which
the frog had sat her mouth appeared, and it wore an
expression of delight such as only a frog's mouth can
assume.

** I have thought it out ; I have found a way !" she
said. " Let two of you, one at each end, take a twig in
your beaks, and I will hang on to it in the middle. You
will fly and I will travel. Only, whatever happens, you
must not quack nor I croak — and then all will be superb."

Now, although, goodness knows, it is by no means a
joke to carry a frog three thousand versts, keeping silent
all the time, still the ingenuity of her plan sent the ducks
into such a delirium of delight that they unanimously
resolved to take the frog with them. They agreed to
relieve each other every two hours, and as there were as
many and many ducks as could be, and only one frog,



THE FROG WHO TRAVELLED 273

no duck's turn to carry the frog would come very often.
They found a good strong twig, two ducks took it in their
beaks, the frog caught hold in the middle with her mouth,
and the whole covey rose into the air. The terrific height
to which they flew up took the frog's breath away.
Besides which, the ducks did not fly evenly, and kept
giving the twig jerks. The poor frog swung in the air
like a paper " tumbling tommy," and hung on by her
jaw with all her might, so as not to be thrown ofi and
flop to the ground. However, she soon became accus-
tomed to her surroundings, and even began to look
around her. Beneath her fields, meadows, rivers, and
mountains passed by in rapid succession, but it was very
difficult for her to take stock of them, because, hanging
as she was from the twig, she could only see backwards
and towards the sky ; nevertheless, she managed to see
something, and was very pleased and proud with herself.

" What a splendid idea it was of mine !" she thought
to herself.

And as the rest of the ducks flew along behind the
first pair which carried her they cried out to her and
praised her.

** Our frog has an astonishingly clever head," they
said. ** It would be difficult to find anything like it even
amongst us ducks."

The frog could scarcely restrain herself from thanking
them, but, remembering that if she opened her mouth she
would fall from a terrific height, she closed her jaw still
tighter, and decided to resist the temptation. She swung
in this manner for a whole day. The ducks who were
carrying her relieved each other on the wing, cleverly
catching hold of the twig. This was most terrifying.
Several times the frog almost croaked from fright, but
it was necessary to have plenty of presence of mind,
which she possessed. In the evening the whole company
halted in a swamp. At dawn the ducks with the frog
continued their journey, but this time their passenger, in



274 THE FRCG WHO TRAVELLED

order to see the better what was happening, fastened on
with her back and head to the front. The ducks fiew
over mown fields, woods turning yellow, and over villages
full of corn-stacks. They could hear the people talking,
and the noise of the machines with which they were
threshing the rye. The villagers looked at the ducks,
and, noticing something strange in their midst, pointed
to it. And the frog longed to fly lower down, so as to
show herself and to hear what they were saying about
her. At the next halt she said :

"Is it possible for us to fiy not quite so high ? It
makes my head swim, and I am afraid of falling if I
should suddenly feel bad."

The kind ducks promised her to fly lower, and the
following day they travelled so low that they could hear
what was said.

*' Look, look !" cried the children in one of the villages ;
" the ducks are carrying a frog \"

The frog heard this, and her heart jumped.
** Look, look \" " grown-ups " cried in another village.
" That's an extraordinary thing !"

" Do they know that it was I who thought of this, and
not the ducks ?" the frog wondered to herself.

" Look, look !" they cried in a third village. '* What
a wonder ! And who thought of such a clever dodge ?"
Thereupon the frog could stand it no longer, and,
throwing caution to the winds, cried out at the top of her
voice :

" It was I— I !"

And with this cry she went tumbling over and over to
the ground. The ducks quacked loudly, and one of them
tried to catch hold of their unfortunate fellow-traveller
as she was falling, but missed her. The frog, frantically
waving all four paws, quickly fell to the ground, but as
the ducks were flying very fast, she did not fall just at
the spot above which she had cried out, and where there
was a hard road, but much farther on, which was ex-



THE FROG WHO TRAVELLED 275

tremely lucky for her, because she flopped into a muddy
pond on the edge of the village.

She quickly appeared from out of the water, and with
all her might began to cry out :

''It was I — it was I who thought of it !"

But there was no one near her. The local frogs,
frightened by the unexpected splash, had all disappeared
under water. When they began to reappear they gazed
at the new arrival with astonishment.

And she related to them a wonderful story of how she
had thought all her life about the matter, and had- at
last invented a new, unusual method of travelling by
ducks. How she had her own special ducks which carried
her where she wanted to go. How she had been in the
beautiful South, where it was so nice, where there are such
lovely warm swamps, and such quantities of midges, and
every other kind of edible insects.

" I have come here to see how you live," she said. " I
shall stay with you until the spring, until my ducks,
which I have let go, return."

But the ducks never returned. They thought that the
frog had been smashed to pieces by her fall, and were
very sorry for her.



XV

A VERY SHORT ROMANCE

Frost and cold. January is approaching, and is making
its coming known to ever}^ unfortunate being — dvorniks
and gorodovois — unable to hide their noses in some warm
place. It is also letting me know. Not because I have
been unable to find a warm corner, but through a whim
of mine.

As a matter of fact, why am I stumping along this
deserted quay ? The lamps are shining brightly, although
the wind keeps forcing its way inside them and making
the gas-jets dance. Their bright light makes the dark
mass of the sumptuous Palace, and especially its windows,
look all the more gloomy. The wind is moaning and
howling across the icy waste of the Neva. Through the
gusts of wind comes the sound of the chimes of the
Fortress Cathedral, and every stroke of the mournful
bells keeps time with the tap of my wooden leg on the
ice-covered granite slabs of the pavement and with the
beating of my aching heart against the walls of its narrow
cell.

I must present myself to the reader. I am a young
man with a wooden leg. Perhaps you will say I am
imitating Dickens. You remember Silas Wegg, the literary
gent with the wooden leg (in " Our Mutual Friend ") ?
No, I am not copying him. I really am a young man
with a wooden leg. Only I have become so recently.

" Ding-dong, ding-dong !" The chimes again ring out

276



A VERY SHORT ROMANCE 277

their doleful chant, and then one o'clock strikes. Only
one o'clock ! Still seven hours before daylight, then this
black winter night, with its cold, wet snow, will give
place to a grey day. Shall I go home ? I do not know.
It is absolutely all the same to me. I have no need of
sleep.

In the spring, also, I loved to spend whole nights walk-
ing up and down this quay. Ah, what nights those are !
What can surpass them ? They are not the scented nights
of the South, with their strange black heaven and big
stars with their pursuing gaze. Here all is light and
bright. The sky with its varied hues is coldly beautiful,
and throughout the night remains gilded north and east
with the rays of a scarce-setting sun. The air is fresh
and keen. The limpid Neva rolls onwards proudly, its
dancing wavelets contentedly lapping against the stone-
work of the quay. I am standing on this quay, and on
my arm a young girl is leaning. And this girl

Ah, good people ! why have I begun to tell you of my
wounds ? But such is the stupidity of the poor human
heart. When it is stricken it dreams of seeking relief
from each it meets, and does not find it. This is, how-
ever, quite intelligible. Who is in want of an old un-
darned stocking ? Everyone endeavours to throw it
away — the farther the better.

My heart was in no need of mending when in the spring
of this year I met Masha — the best of all Mashas in this
world. I met her on this same quay, which was not,
however, as cold as it is now. And I had a real leg
instead of this disgusting wooden stump — a real well-made
leg, like the one that I have left me. Taking me all round,
I was a well-made fellow, and, of course, did not walk, as
now, like some bandy-legged fool. Not a nice word to
use, but at present I cannot pick my words. And so I
met her. It happened quite simply. I was walking
along ; she was walking along. (I am not a Lothario, or
rather was not, because now I have a wooden stump.)



278 A VERY SHORT ROMANCE

I do not know what impelled me to do so, but I spoke.
First of all I, of course, told her I was not one of those
sort of blackguards, etc., then I declared my intentions
were honourable, and so on. My face (on which there is
now a deep furrow above the bridge of my nose (a very
gloomy-looking furrow) calmed her fears, and we walked
together as far as her home. Sue was returning from her
old grandmother, to whom she used to read. The poor
old lady was blind.

Now the grandmother is dead. This year many have
died, and not only old grandmothers. I could have died
very easily, I assure you. But I have not. Oh, how
much trouble can a man stand ? You do not know, and
neither do I.

Very well, Masha ordered me to be a hero, and there-
fore I had to join the army.

The times of the Crusades have passed, and knights are
extinct ; but if she whom you love were to say to you,
" I am this ring," and throw it into a fire, even were it
the greatest possible conflagration, would you not throw
yourself into the flames to get that ring ? Oh, what a
quaint fellow ! " Of course not," you reply — " of course
not. I should go to the best jeweller and buy her another
ring ten times more valuable." And she would say :
" This is not the same ring, but is it an expensive ring ?
I will never believe you." However, I am not of the
same opinion as you, gentle reader. Perhaps the woman
who would appeal to you would act in that way. You,
no doubt, are the proud possessor of many shares and
stocks, and can gratify any wish. You perhaps even
subscribe to a foreign journal for your amusement. Per-
haps you remember as a child having watched a moth
which had flown into a flame ? That also amused you in
those days. The moth lay on its back quivering and
fluttering its little striped wings. This interested you ;
then, when it no longer amused you, you squashed it with



A VERY SHORT ROMANCE 279

your linger, and the unhappy little thing ceased to suffer.
Ah, kind reader, if only you would squash me with
your finger, so that I might cease to suffer !

She was a strange girl. When war was declared she
went about dreamily, and without speaking, for several
days, and nothing I did would amuse her. " Listen,"
she said to me at length, " you are an honourable man ?"

" I may admit that," I replied.

" Honourable people prove their words by deeds. You
were for the war ] you must fight." She puckered her
brows and warmly pressed her little hand into mine.

I looked at Masha, and said seriously : " Yes."

*' When you return I will be your wife," she said to
me on the station platform. " Come back !" Tears
dimmed my sight, and I almost sobbed aloud. But I
kept my self-control, and found strength to answer Masha :

" Remember, Masha, honourable people "

" Prove their words by deeds," said she, finishing the
sentence. I clasped her to my heart for the last time,
and jumped into the railway-carriage.

I went to fight for Masha' s sake, but I did my duty by
my country honourably. I marched bravely through
Roumania amidst rain and dust, heat and cold. Self-
sacrificingly I gnawed the ration biscuit. When we first
met the Turks I did not fail, but won the " Cross " and
promotion as N.C.O. In the second action something
happened, and I fell to the ground. Groans, mist ; a
doctor in white apron with blood-covered hands ; hos-
pital nurses ; my leg, with its birth-mark, taken off below
the knee. All this happened as in a dream. Then the
ambulance-train, with its comfortable cots and dainty
lady in charge, brought me to St. Petersburg.

When you leave a town in the usual and proper way
with two legs, and return to it with one leg and a stump
instead of the other — believe me, it costs something.

They placed me in a hospital. This was in July. I
begged them to find out the address of Mary Ivanovna



28o A VERY SHORT ROMANCE

and the good-natured attendant brought it me.



I wrote, then again, and a third time — but no answer.
My kind reader, I have told you all this, and, of course,
you do not believe me. What an unlikely story ! you say.
A certain knight and a certain crafty traitress — the old,
old story. My intelligent reader, believe me there are
many such knights besides myself.

Eventually they fitted me with a wooden leg, and I
was able now to find out for myself the cause of Masha's
silence. I drove to her house, and then stumped up the
long staircase. How I had flown up it eight months ago !
At last the door. I ring with a sinking at my heart. I
hear footsteps, and the old servant opens the door to me.
Without listening to her joyous exclamations I rush (if it
is possible to rush when your legs are of different kinds)
into the drawing-room. Masha !

She is not alone, but is sitting with a very nice young
fellow, a distant relative, who was at the University with
me, and was expecting to obtain a good appointment
eventually. Both congratulated me very tenderly (prob-
ably owing to my wooden leg), but both were somewhat
confused. Within a quarter of an hour I understood all.

I did not wish to stand in the way of their happiness.
The intelligent reader smiles sceptically. Surely you do
not want me to believe all this ? Who would gratuitously
surrender the girl he loves to any good-for-nothing
fellow ?

First, he is not a good-for-nothing fellow ; and, second,
— well, I would tell you that second only you would not
understand, because you do not believe that virtue and
justice exist nowadays. You would prefer the unhappi-
ness of three persons to the misery of one. You do not
believe me, intelligent reader ? Then don't !

The wedding took place two days ago, and I was best
man. I performed my duties at the ceremony with
dignity, and gave to another what I most prize in this



A VERY SHORT ROMANCE 281

world. Masha from time to time glanced timidly at me,
and her husband regarded me with a perplexed air of
bewilderment. The wedding was a merry one. Cham-
pagne flowed, her German relatives cried " Hoch !" and
called me " der Russische Held." Masha and her husband
were Lutherans.

" Aha !" exclaims the intelligent reader ; *' see how you
have betrayed yourself, sir hero ! Why must you make
use of the Lutheran religion ? Simply because there are
no orthodox marriages in December ! That is the whole
reason and explanation, and the whole narrative is pure
invention."

Think what you like, dear reader. It is a matter of
absolute indifference to me. But were you to come v/ith
me on these December nights along the Palace Qua}/, and
listen to the storm and chimes, and the tap of my wooden
leg on the pavement ; if you could feel what effect these
winter nights have on me ; if you could believe

" Ding-dong, ding-dong !" The chimes are sounding
four o'clock. It is time to go home, and throw myself on
to my lonely bed and sleep.

*' Au re voir," reader !

FROM THE REMINISCENCES OF PRIVATE
IVANOFF

I
On the 4th of May, 1877, I arrived at Kishineff, and half
an hour later had learnt that the 56th Division of Infantry
was passing through the town. As I had come with the
view of enlisting in some regiment and going to the war,
I found myself, on the 7th of May, at 4 a.m., standing in
the street amongst the grey ranks which had been formed
up before the quarters of the Colonel of the 222nd (Staro-
bielsky) Regiment. I was in a grey overcoat with red
shoulder-straps and dark blue facings and a kepi, around
which was a dark blue band. On my back was a knap-
sack, at my waist were cartridge-pouches, and I was
holding a heavy Krinkoff rifle.

The band struck up as they brought out the colours
from the Colonel's quarters. Words of command rang
out and the regiment presented arms. Then followed a
fearful row. The Colonel gave a command which was
taken up by the battalion, company, and, finally, section
commanders, and as the result of all this shouting a
confused and, to me, absolutely incomprehensible move-
ment of grey overcoats took place, which ended in the
regiment drawing itself out into a long column and
marching off with measured tread to the sound of the
regimental band as it thundered out a quick step. I too
stepped out, trying to keep my dressing and to keep in
step with my neighbour. My knapsack pulled me back-

282



REMINISCENCES OF PRIVATE IVANOFF 283

wards, the heavy ammunition pouches pulled me forward ;
my rifle kept jumping off my shoulder, and the grey collar
of my overcoat rubbed my neck. But in spite of all these
little discomforts, the music, the rhythmic, ponderous
movement of the column bristling with bayonets, the
freshness of early morning, and the sight of the sunburnt
and stem faces, all combined to inspire a feeling of calm
determination.

Notwithstanding the earliness of the hour, people
flocked to the courtyard gates of the houses, and half-
dressed figures gazed at us from windows. We marched
through the long straight street past the bazaar, where
the Moldavians were already commencing to arrive in
their ox-carts. The street wound up the hill and stopped
at the town cemetery. The morning became overcast,
and a cold drizzle commenced. The trees of the cemetery
were discernible through the mist, and glimpses of tomb-
stones could be caught above its gates and walls. As we
skirted the cemetery, leaving it to our right, it seemed to
me that it gazed perplexedly at us through the mist,
asking : ** Why are you going thousands and thousands
of versts to die on foreign fields when it is possible to die
here — to die peacefully, and lie beneath my wooden
crosses and stone slabs ? Stop here !"

But we did not stop. An unknown, mysterious force
was drawing us — the strongest force in human life. Each
of us, taken separately, would have gone home, but the
whole mass went forward in obedience to discipline, and
not from any recognition of the justice of the cause, nor
from any feeling of hatred towards an unknown enemy ;
not from any fear of punishment, but moved solely by
that hidden and unconscious something which will, for
many a long day yet, lead humanity to sanguinary
slaughter — the most potent cause of every description of
human ill and suffering.

A wide and deep valley which stretched away beyond
sight into the mist opened out behind the cemetery.



284 REMINISCENCES OF PRIVATE IVANOFF

The rain became heavier. Somewhere far, far away, the
clouds had made way for a ray of sunshine which caused
the slanting and perpendicular strips of rain to glisten
like silver. Through the mist which rolled along the
green slopes of the valley could be distinguished long
columns of troops ahead of us. Now and then there was
the gleam of bayonets. And the guns, as they came into
the sunlight, shone like some bright star, only to vanish
in the course of a few moments. Sometimes the clouds
came together ; it became darker and the rain more fre-
quent. An hour after our start I felt a little stream of
cold water begin to trickle down my back.
The first stage was not a long one, the distance from

Kishineff to the village of G being in all only eighteen

versts. However, not being accustomed to carry a w^eight
of 20 to 35 pounds, I was at first unable even to eat when
we at length reached the cottage told off to us. I leant
against the wall, resting on my knapsack, and stood like
this for some ten minutes fully equipped with my rifle in
my hand. One of the soldiers going to the kitchen for his
dinner took pity on me and took my canteen with him..
But on his return he found me sound asleep. I slept until
four o'clock in the morning, when I was awakened by the
insufferably harsh sounds of a bugle sounding the
" assembly/' and five minutes later I was again plodding
along the muddy, sticky road under a fine drizzling rain.
Before me jogged a grey back, on which was strapped a
brown calfskin knapsack and an iron canteen, which
rattled incessantly. The grey back had a rifle on one
shoulder. On either side and behind me were similar
grey figures. For the first few days I could not dis-
tinguish them one from the other. The 222nd Infantry
Regiment of the Line which I had joined consisted for
the most part of peasants from the Governments of
Vyatka and Kostroma. They all had broad faces, now
blue with cold, prominent cheek-bones, and small grey
eyes. Most of them were fair, with light-coloured hair



REMINISCENCES OF PRIVATE IVANOFF 285

and beards. Although I knew the names of several, I
could not pick out their owners. A fortnight later I was
unable to understand how I could ever have mixed up
my tw^o comrades, the one marching alongside me, and
the other the possessor of the grey back which was con-
stantly before my eyes. At first I had called them
Feodoroff and Jitkoff indifferently, continually making
mistakes, although they did not in the least resemble each
other. Feodoroff, a corporal, was a young man of
twenty-two, of average height, and splendidly built.
His face, with its beautifully chiselled nose and lips, was
as regular in its features as if it had been the work of
some sculptor. His chin was covered with a fair curly
beard, and there was a merry twinkle in his blue eyes.
When the command was " Singers to the front !" he used
to be the leader of our company. He was the possessor
of a tenor voice, and would sing falsetto when high notes
were necessary. He was a native of the Vladimir
Government, but had lived since childhood in St. Peters-
burg. Contrary to the general rule, Petersburg ** educa-
tion " had not spoilt him, but had merely polished him,
and had taught him to read the papers and to speak
" wise words."

" Of course, Vladimir Mikhailovich," he used to say to
me, " I can judge better than ' Uncle ' Jitkoff, because
* Peter '* has set its mark on me. There is a civilization
in ' Peter,' but nothing but ignorance and savagery in
the provinces. However, as he is not a young man, but,
so to speak, has seen things and undergone various
vicissitudes of fate, I cannot shout at him. He is forty,
and I am only in my twenty-third year. But I am a
corporal."

" Uncle " Jitkoff was a gnarled - looking peasant of

extraordinary strength and a perpetually morose visage.

His face was swarthy. He had prominent cheek-bones

and little eyes, which looked out from under his eyebrows.

* The people's name for St. Petersburg.



286 REMINISCENCES OF PRIVATE IVANOFF

He never smiled, and rarely spoke. He was a carpenter
by trade, and was on '* indefinite leave " w^hen the
mobilization order was issued. He had only a lew
months more to serve in the reserve when the war broke
out and compelled him to take part in the campaign,
leaving a wafe and five small children behind him at home.
In spite of an unprepossessing exterior and perpetual
moroseness, there was something attractive in him —
something kind and strong. Now, as I have said, it
seems quite unintelligible to me how I could ever have
mixed up these two neighbours, but for the first two days
they seemed alike to me. Each was grey ; each was
tired and benumbed with the cold.

The rain was unceasing during the whole first half of
May, and we were marching without tents. The seem-
ingly never-ending sticky road rose over hills and dipped
into gullies almost every verst. It w^as heavy marching.
Clumps of mud stuck to our feet, a leaden grey sky hung
low and threateningly over us, and rained a continual
fine drizzle on us, and there was no end to it. There was
no hope of drying and warming ourselves when we reached
the night's camp. The Roumanians would not let us
into their cottages, and, indeed, there was no room
anywhere for such a mass of men. We used to march
through the town or village and camp anywhere on the
common.

" Halt ! . . . Pile arms !"

And there was nothing for it, when we had eaten our
hot broth, but to lie down actually in the mud. Water
below, water above. It seemed as if one's whole body
was permeated with water.

Shivering, w^e wrapped ourselves up in our great-coats,
and, gradually getting warm with a moist warmth, slept
soundly until again awakened by the universally detested
" assembly." Then again the grey column, the grey sky,
muddy road, and dismal dripping hills and valleys. It
was hard on us.



REMINISCENCES OF PRIVATE IVANOFF 287

" They have opened all the windows of heaven," said,
with a sigh, our squad leader, a N.C.O. named Karpoff,
a veteran who had served through the Khiva campaign.
*' We are soaked and soaked without end."

'' We shall get dry, Vasil Karpich ! Look, there is
the sun peeping out ; it will dry us all. The march will
be a long one. We shall have time to get dry and wet
again before we reach the end of it. Mikhailich !" said
my neighbour, turning to me, " is it far to the Danube ?"

" Another three weeks yet."

" Three weeks ! But we shall get there in two
weeks. ..."

" We are going straight into the clutches of the devil,"
muttered " Uncle " Jitkoff.

*' What are you growling about, you old blackguard ?
You are only making mischief. Where the devil are we
going to ? Why do you say things like that ?"

*' Well, are we going on a holiday ?" snarled Jitkoff.

" No, not on a holiday, but as our duty calls us, to
carry out our oath. . . . What did you say when you
were sworn in ? Not sparing your life. You old fool !
Take care what you are saying !"

'* But what did I say, Vasil Karpich ? Am I not
going ? If to die, then to die. . . . It's all the same. ..."

'* Well, don't let's hear any more of it."

Jitkoff relapsed into silence. His face became still
more morose. For the matter of that, it was no time
fo» talking. The going was too heavy. The feet kept
slipping, and men kept constantly falling into the sticky
mud. Deep swearing resounded through the battalion.
Only Feodoroff did not hang his head, but kept un-
wearyingly relating to me story after story of Petersburg
and the country.

However, there is an end to all things. One day, when
I woke up in the morning in our bivouac near a village
where a halt had been arranged, I saw a blue sky, huts
with white plastered walls, and vineyards bathed in the



288 REMINISCENCES OF PRIVATE IVANOFF

bright morning sun, and heard gay, animated voices. All
had already risen, had dried their clothes, and had re-
covered from the arduous ten days' march in the rain
without tents. During the halt they were brought up.
The soldiers immediately stretched them out, and, having
pitched them properly, driven in the tent-pegs, and
tightened the canvas, were almost all lying in their shade.

** They did not help us when it was raining. They will
guard us from the sun."

" Yes, so the ' Barin's ' face shan't get burnt," joked
Feodoroff, slyly winking towards me.



II

We had only two officers in our company — the com-
pany commander, Captain Zaikin, and a subaltern officer,
a lieutenant of the reserve named Stebelkoff. The
company commander was a man of middle age, rather
stout, and of jovial disposition. Stebelkoff was a youth
only just out of the Academy. They lived on good terms
with each other. The Captain took care of the Lieutenant,
messed him, and during the rain even sheltered him under
his own waterproof cloak. When they issued out the
tents our officers camped together, and as the officers'
tents were spacious, the Captain decided to take me in
with him.

Tired out by a sleepless night, our company had been
told off to help the transport, and had spent the wliole
night in dragging it out of gullies, and had even pulled
the carts and waggons out of swollen streams by singing.

I was sleeping soundly after dinner, when the Captairi'o
servant awoke me by cautiously touching my shoulder.

" Sir, Mr. Ivanoff, Mr. Ivanoff " he whispered, as

if he did not want to awake me, but rather was trying all
he could not to disturb my sleep.

*' What's the matter ?"

" The Captain wants you." Then, seeing me putting



REMINISCENCES OF PRIVATE IVANOFF 289

on my belt and bayonet, added : ** He said I was to bring
you just as you were."

A whole crowd had assembled in Zaikin's tent. Besides
its usual occupants there were two more officers — the
regimental Adjutant and the commander of the rifle
company, named Ventzel. In 1877 ^ battalion did not
consist, as now, of four companies, but of five. On ser-
vice the rifle company brought up the rear, so that the
rear files of our company were in touch with their front
files. I often marched almost amongst the riflemen, and
I had already several times heard from them the most
uncomplimentary remarks about Staff-Captain Ventzel.
All four officers were seated around a box which took
the place of a table, and on which stood a samovar,
plates and dishes, etc., and a bottle, and were drink-
ing tea.

" Mr. Ivanoff ! Come in, please," cried out the Cap-
tain. " Nikita ! Bring a cup, mug, or glass, or whatever
you have. Ventzel, move up a bit, and let Ivanoff sit
down."

Ventzel stood up and bowed very courteously. He was
a short, raw-boned, pale, and nervous-looking young man*
What restless eyes ! and what thin lips ! were the thoughts
which came into my head when I first saw him. The
Adjutant, without rising, stretched out his hand.
*' Lukin," he said briefly, introducing himself.

I felt awkward. The officers were silent. Ventzel was
sipping tea in which w^as some rum. The Adjutant was
pulling at a short pipe, and Stebelkoff, the Lieutenant,
having nodded to me, went on reading a battered volume,
a t. auslation of some novel which went through the march
from Russia to the Danube with him in a portmanteau
and subsequently returned home in a still more battered
state. My host poured out some tea into a large earthen-
ware mug and added an enormous go of rum.

*' How are you, Mr. Student ? Don't be angry with
me. I am a plain man. Yes, and all of us here, you

19



290 REMINISCENCES OF PRIVATE IVANOFF

know, are just common folk. But you are an educated
man, so you must excuse us. Isn't that so ?"

And he seized my hand with his huge fist as a bird of
prey seizes its booty, and waved it several times in the
air, looking at me with a kind expression in his prominent
round little eyes.

'' Are you a student ?" inquired Ventzel.

'* Yes, sir, I was."

He smiled and raised his restless eyes on me. I re-
called the soldiers' stories I had heard about him, and
doubted their truth.

"Why 'sir'? Here in this tent we are all alike.
Here you are simply an intelligent man amongst others
like yourself," he said quietly.

" An intelligent man ! Yes, that's true," exclaimed
Zaikin. " A student ! I like students, although they
are such insubordinate beggars. I should have been a
student myself if it had not been for fate."

*' What was your particular fate, Ivan Platonich ?"
inquired the Adjutant.

*' Why, I simply could not work up for exams. Mathe-
matics were not so bad, but as for the rest ... it was
hopeless. Literature, composition. I never learnt to
write properly when I was a cadet. Honestly !"

" Do you know, Mr. Student," said the Adjutant
between two gigantic puffs of smoke, " how Ivan Pla-
tonich makes four spelling mistakes in one simple
word ?"

" Come, come, don't tell lies, old chap," said Zaikin
with a wave of his hand.

** It's quite true ; I am not lying," said the Adjutant,
laughing heartily as he spelt the word a la Zaikin.

" Laugh away ! But the Adjutant himself is no
better," said Zaikin, giving a specimen in his turn.

The Adjutant roared with laughter. Stebelkoff, who
happened to have his mouth full of tea, spluttered it over
his novel and put out one of the two candles which lighted



REMINISCENCES OF PRIVATE IVANOFF 291

the tent. I too could not help laughing. Ivan Platonich,
thoroughly pleased with his witticism, went off into peals
of deep laughter. Only Ventzel did not laugh.

" It was literature, then, Ivan Platonich ?" he inquired
quietly as before.

" Literature. . . . Yes, and other things. It reminds
me of a man who only knew of the equator in geography
and the meaning of the word ' era ' in history. But, no,
I am speaking rot. That wasn't the reason. It was
simply that I had money and would never do any work.
I, Ivanoff ... I beg your pardon, what's your name ?"

" Vladimir Mikhailich."

*' Vladimir Mikhailich ? Thank you. . . . Well, I was
a light-headed fellow from the very first, and what tricks
I used to play ! You know the song about the boy who
had money.

" I entered this famous, although a purely line regiment,
as a junker. They sent me to school. I only just
passed, and now I have been twenty years slaving in the
service. Now we are dodging after the Turk. Drink
up, gentlemen — drink properly ! Is it worth while
spoiling good tea ? Let us drink, gentlemen, to ' Food
for powder.' "

" Chair a canon," said Ventzel.

" Well, all right, in French, if you like. Our Captain,
Vladimir Mikhailich, is a clever man. He knows several
languages, and can repeat a lot of German poetry by heart.
Look here, young man, I sent for you to propose you
should transfer yourself into my tent. Where you are
now there are six of you, and it is stifling and crowded
with soldiers. Besides, they are not over clean. In any
case, you will be better off with us."

** Thank you, but please allow me to refuse your
offer."

"Why? Bosh! Nikita ! Go and fetch his knap-
sack ! Which tent are you in ?"

'* The second on the right. But please allow me to



292 REMINISCENCES OF PRIVATE IVANOFF

stay there. I have to be more with the men, and it is
better I should be altogether with them."

The Captain looked at me attentively, as if desirous
of reading my thoughts. Having pondered a little, he said :

'* What is it ? You want to makp friends with the
men ?"

" Yes, if it is possible."

** That's right. Don't change. I respect you for it."

And he grabbed my hand and once more waved it in
the air.

Soon aften^^ards I took farewell of the officers and left
the tent. It had growTi dark. The men were putting
on their great-coats in preparation for evening prayers.
The companies were drawn up in their lines, so that each
battalion formed a closed square, within which were the
tents and piled arms. Owing to the halt, the whole of
our division had got together. The drums were beating
tattoo, and from afar could be heard the words of the
command preparatory to prayers :

" Remove caps !"

And twelve thousand men bared their heads. " Our
Father which art in Heaven," began our company. The
chant was taken up around us. Sixty choirs of two
hundred men each, and each choir singing independently.
There were discordant notes to be heard, but, neverthe-
less, the hymn produced a stirring and solemn effect.
Gradually the choirs came to an end. Finally, the last
company of the battalion at the far end of the camp
sang, '' But deliver us from evil." The drums gave a
short roll, and the order :

" Put on head-dress !" was given.

The soldiers laid themselves down to sleep. In our
tent, where, as in the other tents, six men occupied a
space of two square sajenes, my place was near the walls
of the tent, and for a long time I lay gazing at the stars,
at the camp-fires of other troops far from us, and listening
to the low, confused murmur of a large camp. In the



REMINISCENCES OF PRIVATE IVANOFF 293

neighbouring tent someone was telling a fairy-tale, ever-
lastingly interspersed with " And after that . . ." *' and
after that this prince went to his spouse and began to
scold her about everything. And after that she . . .
Lutikoff, are you asleep ? Well, sleep, then, and God
be with you," murmured the narrator of the tale, and
lapsed into silence.

The sound of conversation was audible from the
officers' tent also, and the movements of the officers
sitting there were revealed in distorted form against the
canvas by the light of the candles. From time to time
could be heard the noisy laugh of the Adjutant. An
armed sentry was pacing his beat in our lines. Opposite,
and not far from us, was the artillery camp, with yet
another sentry with drawn sword. The stamping of the
horses picketed in their lines, and their deep bretahing
as they quietly chewed their oats, could be plainly heard,
a sound which recalled nights passed at post-stages in
now far-away homeland on just such quiet starlight nights
as this one.

The Great Bear constellation was shining low down
on the horizon, much lower down than with us in Russia.
Gazing at the North Star, I pondered as to the exact
direction in which St. Petersburg lay, where I had left
my mother, friends, and all dear to me. Above my
head familiar star groups were shining. The Milky
Way shone in a bright, majestically calm, band of light.
Towards the South burned the great stars of some con-
stellations unknown to me, one with a red, and the other
with a greenish fire. I wondered whether I should see
any other strange stars when we were across the Danube
and Balkans, and into Constantinople.

As I did not feel sleepy, I got up and commenced to
stroll along the damp grass between our lines and the
artillery. A dark figure came up with me, and, guessing
by the clinking of a sword that it was an officer, I turned
to my front. It proved to be Ventzel.



294 REMINISCENCES OF PRIVATE IVANOFF

" Not asleep, Vladimir Mikhailich?" he inquired in a
soft, quiet voice.

" No, sir."

" My name is Peter Nicolaievitch . . . and I also cannot
sleep. ... I sat and sat with your Captain. But it was
boring. They sat down to cards, and were all drinking
too much. . . . Ah, what a night !"

He walked alongside me, and, reaching the end of our
lines, we turned and continued to pace backwards and
forwards in this manner several times, neither of us
saying anything. Ventzel was the first to break the
silence.

" Tell me, you have started on this campaign volun-
tarily r

" Yes."

" What induced you to do so ?"

" How can I explain ?" I replied, not wishing to go
into details. " Chiefly, of course, a desire to experience
and see things personally."

*' And probably to study the people in thejperson of
its representative — the soldier ?" inquired Ventzel. It
was dark, and I could not see the expression on his face,
but I detected the irony in his tone.

'* How could one study here? How can one study
when one only thinks of how to get to the night's camp
and sleep ?"

'* No ; without joking, teU me why you would not
transfer yourself to your Captain's tent ? Surely you
do not value the opinion of a moujik ?"

" Certainly I value the opinion of anyone whose opinion
I have no reason not to respect."

" I have no reason to disbelieve you. Besides, it is
the fashion nowadays. Even literature presents the
moujik as a masterpiece of creation."

" But who is speaking of masterpieces of creation,
Peter Nicolaievitch ? If only they would recognize him
as a man."



REMINISCENCES OF PRIVATE IVANOFF 295

" Enough of such sentimentality, please ! Who does
not recognize him as a man ? A man ? Well, granted
he is a man, but what sort is another question. . . . Well,
let's talk of something else."

We did, in fact, talk a great deal. Ventzel had evidently-
read a great deal, and, as Zaikin had said, " knew
languages."

The Captain's remark that he could recite poetry also
proved to be true. We talked about French writers,
and Ventzel, having censured the " Realist " school,
went back to the thirties and forties, and even recited
with feeling Alfred de Musset's " A December Night.'*
His rendering of it was good, simple, and expressive, and
with a good accent. Having recited it, he was silent, and
then added :

" Yes, it is good, but all the French authors put
together are not worth ten lines of Schiller, Goethe, or
Shakespeare."

Until he got his company, he had charge of the regi-
mental library, and had followed Russian literature
closely.

Talking of it, he expressed himself strongly against
what he termed its " boorish tendency." The conversa-
tion then reverted to the old subject. Ventzel argued
heatedly :

" When I was almost a boy, I entered the regiment,
and I did not then think what I am telling you now.
I tried to act by mere force of word. I endeavoured to
obtain some moral influence over the men. But after a
year they had exhausted me. All that remained from the
so-called good books coming into contact with actuality
proved to be sentimental bosh, and now I am convinced
that the only way of making oneself understood is —
that !"

He made some sort of gesture with his hand. But it
was so dark that I did not understand it.

** What, Peter Nicolaievitch ?"



296 REMINISCENCES OF PRIVATE IVANOFF

" A clenched fist !" he interjected.

" But good-night ; it is time to sleep.'*

I saluted and went back to my own tent, sorry and
disgusted.

They were apparently all asleep, but a minute later,
when I had laid down, Feodoroff , who was sleeping along-
side me, asked quietly :

** Mikhailich, are you asleep ?"

" No, why 1"

" Were you walking with Venztel ?"

" Yes."

" How was he ? Quiet ?"

" All right — quiet and even kind."

*' Well, well. What it means to be a brother Barin !
He isn't like that with us."

*' What do you mean ? Is he really very bad-
tempered ?"

" I should just think so — awful. He makes their
teeth rattle in the second rifle company, the beast !"

And Feodoroff forthwith fell asleep, so that in reply
to my next question I heard only his even and calm
breathing. I wrapped myself up more tightly in my big
cloak. My thoughts became at first confused, and then
disappeared in sound sleep.

Ill

The rain was followed by heat. About this time we
left the little village w^here our feet used to stick in the
slippery mud, and came on to the main road leading from
Yass to Bukarest. Our first march along this road from
Tekuch to Berlada will always be remembered by those
who made it. It was thirty-five degrees (Reaumur) in the
shade, and the distance was forty-eight versts. It was
perfectly still. A fine dust, full of lime, which was being
raised by thousands of feet, hung over the road. It got
into our noses and mouths, and powdered our hair so
thickly that it was impossible to distinguish its colour.



REMINISCENCES OF PRIVATE IVANOFF 297

Settling all over our perspiring faces, it became mud,
and turned us into niggers. For some reason we marched
in our tunics instead of in our shirt-sleeves. The black
cloth drew the sun, which literally baked our heads
through our black shakos. The almost red-hot stones of
the metalled road could be felt through the soles of our
boots. The men kept on " falling out." To add to our
misfortunes, there were few wells along the route, and there
was for the most part so little water in them that the
head of our column (it was a whole division) exhausted
the supply, and after frightful crushing and pushing at
the wells, we found only a sticky liquid more resembling
mud than water. When there was not even this, the
men used to fall, utterly done up. On this day in ou
battalion alone about ninety men fell out along the road.
Three died from sunstroke.

Compared with my comrades, this trial affected me
but lightly. Possibly because the majority of my
battalion hailed from the North, whereas I had been
accustomed from childhood to the heat of the Steppe.
Perhaps, also, there was another cause. I had occasion
to note that the common soldier, speaking generally,
takes physical suffering more to heart than is the case
with those drawn from the so-called privileged classes.
(I am referring only to those who went to the war as
volunteers.) To the ordinary soldier physical misfor-
tunes were a source of genuine grief, capable of producing
depression and, in general, mental torture. Those who
were going to the war as volunteers of course suffered,
physically speaking, no less, but rather more, than the
soldier drawn from the lower class — owing to a more
tender upbringing, comparative bodily weakness, etc.,
but inwardly were calmer. Their spiritual world could
not be disturbed by bleeding feet, insufferable heat, and
deadly tiredness. Never have I experienced such com-
plete spiritual calm, such peace within myself, and such
contentment with life as when I was undergoing these



298 REMINISCENCES OF PRIVATE IVANOFF

hardships, and went forward under a rain of bullets to
kill people. All this may seem wild and strange, but I
am only writing the truth.

However that may be, when others fell by the road-
side I still kept up.

In Tekuch I supplied myself with an enormous cala-
bash water-bottle, holding at least four flaskfuls. It
often cost me dear to fill it. Half of the water I used to
keep for myself, and the other half I shared out to my
comrades. A man would force himself to plod along,
but in the end the heat would claim him. His legs would
begin to bend under him, his body reel as if drunk.
Through the thick layer of grime and dust could be seen
the apoplectic hue of his face as his trembling hands
gripped his rifle. A gulp of w^ater would revive him for
a few minutes, but eventually the man would fall sense-
less into the road thick with lime-dust. Hoarse voices
would cry out *' Orderly !" It was the orderly's duty
to drag the fallen man to one side, and assist him although
he was himself almost in the same condition. The ditches
along the road were sown with prostrate men. . . .
Feodoroff and Jitkoff were marching alongside me, and,
though obviously suffering, were endeavouring to hold
out. The heat was affecting each reversely, according to
his temperament. Talkative Feodoroff kept silent, merely
giving an occasional deep sigh, and a piteous look was in
his beautiful but now dust-inflamed eyes. *' Uncle "
Jitkoff, on the other hand, kept up a continuous flow of
abuse and argument.

" Look at him, tumbling down — he wiU stick me with

his bayonet, d n him ! ..." he would cry angrily,

avoiding some fallen soldier, the point of whose bayonet
had nearly caught him in the eye. " Lord ! why are you
sending this on us ? If it wasn't for that brute I should
fall myself."

" Who is the brute, ' Uncle ' ?" I asked.

*' Niemtseff, the Staff-Captain. He is orderly officer



REMINISCENCES OF PRIVATE IVANOFF 299

to-day, and is in the rear. Better to go ahead or else
he will beat me black and blue."

I already knew that the men had changed the name
Ventzel into Niemtseff. The two names were not unlike
in Russian. I stepped out of the ranks. It was a little
easier marching along the side of the road. There was
less dust and not so much jostling. Many were doing
this. On this unfortunate day nobody cared about
keeping the ranks. Gradually I dropped behind my
company, and found myself at the tail of the column.

Ventzel, worn out and breathless but excited, caught
me up.

*' How are you getting on ?" he inquired, in a hoarse
voice. ** Let us go along the side of the road. I am
absolutely worn out."

" Do you want some water 7"

He greedily took several gulps from my water-bottle.
" Thank you, I feel better now. What a day !"
For a little time we marched side by side in silence.
*' By the way," he said, " you have not transferred
yourself to Ivan Platonich ?"
" No."

" More fool you. Excuse my outspokenness. Au
revoir. I am wanted at the tail of the column. For
some reason many of these tender creations are falling
down."

Having gone a few paces farther, I turned my head
and saw Ventzel bend over a fallen soldier, and drag him
by the shoulder.

" Get up, you blackguard ! Get up !"
I literally did not recognize my educated conversation-
alist. He was pouring out an endless flow of the coarsest
abuse. The soldier was almost senseless, and his lips
were murmuring something as he gazed up with a hopeless
expression at the infuriated officer.

" Get up ! Get up immediately , Aha ! you won't ?
Then take that, and that, and that !"



300 REMINISCENCES OF PRIVATE IVANOFF

Ventzel had seized his sword, and was dealing blow
after blow with its iron scabbard over the wretched man's
shoulders, all blistered and aching from the weight of his
knapsack and rifle. I could stand it no longer, and went
up to Ventzel.

" Peter Nicolaievitch !"

" Get up ! . . ." His arm with the sword was once
more raised for a blow, when I succeeded in seizing it
firmly.

" For God's sake, Peter Nicolaievitch, leave him
alone !"

He turned a frenzied face towards me. He was a
terrifying sight with his eyes half out of his head, and
a distorted mouth, which was convulsively twitching.
With a sharp movement he wrenched his arm from my
hold. I thought that he would roar at me for my bold-
ness (to seize an officer by the arm was certainly most
daring), but he restrained himself.

** Listen, Ivanoff ; never do this. If, in my place, there
was some other brute, such as Schuroff or Timothieff,
you would have paid dearly for your pleasantry. You
must remember that you are a private, and that for such
action you could be vvithout further words — shot."

"It is all the same to me. I could not see and not
interfere."

" It does honour to your tender feelings. But apply
them elsewhere. Can one act otherwise with these ? . . ."
(His face assumed an expression of contempt — nay, more,
hatred.) *' Perhaps ten of these scores who have given
way and fallen down like a lot of old women are really
absolutely played out. I am doing this not from cruelty.
I have none in my nature. But one must maintain
discipline. If it was possible to reason with them, I
would talk, but words have no effect on them. They
understand and feel only physical pain."

I did not hear him out, but started to overtake my
com-pany, which was already far av/ay. I caught up



REMINISCENCES OF PRIVATE IVANOFF 301

Feodoroff and JitkofT as our battalion debouched from
the road into a field and was halted.

" What were you talking about, Mikhailich, with Staff-
Captain Ventzel ?" asked Feodoroff, when, thoroughly
exhausted, I threw myself down near him, after having
with difficulty piled my arm.

" Talking," muttered Jitkoff.

" Can you call it talking ? He seized him by the arm."

'* Take care, Ivanoff, sir. Be careful of Niemtseff.
Don't be misled because he likes to talk with you. It
will cost you dear."

IV

Late that evening we reached Fokshan, passed through
the unlighted, silent, and dusty little town, and came out
somewhere into a field. It was as dark as pitch ; the
battalions were camped anyhow, and worn-out men slept
as if dead. Scarcely anyone cared to eat the " dinner "
which had been prepared. The soldier's food is always
dinner, whether it is early morning, daytime, or night.
All night long stragglers were coming in. At dawn we
were again on the march, but consoled ourselves with the
act that at the end of it there was to be a day's halt.

Once again the moving ranks, once again the knapsack
presses benumbed shoulders, once again the pain of sore
and bleeding feet. But the first ten versts were per-
formed in a kind of stupor. The short sleep we had had
was not able to destroy the fatigue of yesterday, and the
men practically slept as they marched. I slept so soundly
that when we had our first halt I could not believe we had
already covered ten versts, and could not recall any one
part of the road we had traversed. Only when, as a
prelude to a halt, the columns begin to close in and
re-form does one awake and think with joy of an hour's
rest and the possibility of throwing off one's pack, of
boiling water in one's canteen, and lying free whilst
sipping hot tea. As soon as arms are piled and knap-



302 REMINISCENCES OF PRIVATE IVANOFF

sacks removed the majority commence collecting fire-
wood — almost always the dry stalks of last year's maize-
crops. Two bayonets are stuck into the ground, a ram-
rod is laid on them, and two or three canteens hung on
it. The dry, brittle stalks burn brightly and merrily.
The flames lick the blackened canteens, and within ten
minutes the water is boiling hard. The men used to
throw the tea straight into the kettle, allowing it to boil
for a short timxC, which resulted in a strong, almost black,
tea, drunk for the most part without sugar, as the com-
missariat, while issuing plenty of tea (the men even
smoked it when out of tobacco), gave us very little sugar.
The tea was drunk in enormous quantities. A canteen
which held about seven glasses was the usual one man's
portion.

Perhaps it seems strange that I go into such details.
But a soldier's life, when campaigning, is so hard, and
entails so much deprivation, and the future holds out so
little hope, that even tea or some such similar small
luxury gives enormous pleasure. It was necessary to
see, to realize with what serious, contented faces sunburnt,
rough, and stem soldiers, young and old — true it is that
there were scarcely any over forty years of age amongst
us — like children, laid little sticks and stalks under the
canteens, looked after the fire, and advised each other.

" You, Lutikoff, push them to the edge. That's it. . . .
They have begun to bum. Now the water will boil
soon."

Tea, and sometimes in cold and rainy weather a glass of
vodka, or a pipe of tobacco, comprised the sum-total of
a soldier's pleasures, excluding, of course, all-healing
sleep, when it was possible to forget bodily misfortunes
and thoughts of a dark and terrifying future. Tobacco
played no small role amongst these joys of life, exciting
and supporting exhausted nerves. A tightly filled pipe
would go round ten men, and, being returned to its owner,
he would take the last pull, knock out the ash, and, with



REMINISCExNCES OF PRIVATE IVANOFF 303

an air of importance, secrete the pipe in the upper part
of his jack-boot. I remember my grief at the loss of my
pipe by one of my friends to whom I had lent it for a
smoke, and how he, too, was grieved and ashamed about
it, just as if he had lost a whole fortune entrusted to him.

At the chief halt (about midday) we used to rest for
an hour and a half to two hours. After drinking our tea
everyone would sleep. Quiet would reign in the bivouac.
Only the sentry on the colours would pace to and fro,
and some one or other of the officers would keep awake.

We would lie on the ground with our knapsacks under
our heads, neither asleep nor awake. The scorching sun
would bum our faces and necks. Flies would keep buzzing
everlastingly around us, making real sleep impossible.
Dreams mingled with reality. It was so short a time ago
that life had been so different that in half-conscious
slumber one expected to wake and find oneself at home ;
that this Steppe would disappear ; this bare soil, with
thorny bushes in place of grass ; this pitiless sun and hot
wind ; these thousands of strangely attired men in dust-
stained shirts ; these piles of arms. It was all like some
hideous nightmare.

Then the powerful voice of our little bearded battalion
Major, Chemoglazoff, would give the command, " Ri-ise,"
in a long-drawn-out and severe tone of voice, and the
prostrate crowd of white shirts would move, stretch
itself, rise, and commence to strap on its equipment,
and form ranks — " Unpile arms !"

We take our rifles. Even now I well remember my
rifle, No. 18,635, with its stock rather darker than the
others, and a long scratch along the dark varnish. Yet
another command, and the battalion, forming column,
turns on to the road. At the extreme front of the
column the Major's horse was led, a prancing bay stallion
called Vavara. The Major only rode on extreme occa-
sions, always marching at the head of the battalion with
Vavara, a true infantryman. He wished to show the



304 REMINISCENCES OF PRIVATE IVANOFF

soldiers that the '' authorities " also endeavoured to do
their duty, and the soldiers loved him for it. He was
always cool and collected, never joked nor smiled. He
was the first to rise in the morning and the last to lie
down at night. His manner toward the men was firm
and restrained, and he never allowed himself to rage or
shout without reason. It was said that but for. him
goodness knows what Ventzel might have done.

To-day is hot, but not like yesterday. We are no
longer marching along the metalled road, but parallel
with the railway, along a narrow by-road, so that most
of us are marching over grass. There is no dust. Clouds
are racing overhead. At intervals there are big rain-
drops. We gaze upwards at the clouds and stretch out
our hands to see if it is really raining. Even yesterday's
stragglers have taken heart. It is no distance now, only
some ten versts, and then a rest — the longed-for rest — not
merely for one short night, but all night, the next day, and
even that night too. The men, having cheered up, want
to sing, and Feodoroff breaks out into the weU-known song
about Poltava. Having sung how suddenly a mischief-
making bullet found its way into the Imperial head-
dress, he switched off into an idiotic and somewhat
obscene, but extremely popular, song amongst men, about
a certain Liza who went into the woods and found a bee-
hive there, and all that happened from this find. Then
followed the historic song about Peter the Great and the
Senate, and, finally, a song of some fifty verses, an effort
by the local talent of our battalion.

" Feodoroff," I asked one day, *' why do you sing all
that bosh about Liza ?"

I mentioned several other songs, idiotic and cynical to
a degree.

" Orders, Vladimir Mikhailich. But why ? Do you
really call it singing ? It is really a kind of screeching,
just to work the chest and to make marching more
lively."



REMINISCENCES OF PRIVATE IVANOFF 305

The singers tire themselves out, and the band begins
to play. It is much easier to step out to the measured,
loud, and, for the most part, lively marches. All, even
the most tired, pull themselves together, march strictly
in step, and keep their dressing. It is difficult to recog-
nize the battahon. I remember how once we marched
more than six versts in an hour without feeling tired,
thanks to the band. But when the exhausted bandsmen
ceased playing, the influence of the music went, and I
felt as if I should drop straightaway, and so I should have
done had not there been an opportune halt.

About five versts from our halt we came upon an
obstacle. We were marching through the valley of some
little river. On the one side there were mountains and
on the other a narrow and somewhat high railway embank-
ment. The recent rains had flooded the valley and con-
verted our road into a kind of lake about thirty sajenes
wide. The bed of the railway rose above it like a dam,
and we had to cross over by it. A ganger on the line let
the first battalion over, which thus successfully avoided
the lake, but then declared that a train was due in five
minutes' time, and we must wait. We halted and had
just piled arms, when the well-known carriage of the
Brigadier-General appeared at the turn of the road.

He was a great man. I have never heard such a voice
as he possessed, either on the operatic stage or amongst
cathedral choirs. The echoes of his bass resounded in
the air like a trumpet, his big well-fed figure, with its red,
big head, enormous dark-coloured whiskers waving in the
breeze, and heavy black eyebrows surmounting tiny little
eyes, which shone like needles, was a most inspiring
sight as he sat on his horse giving commands to the
brigade. On one occasion on the manoeuvre-ground at
Moscow during some evolutions, his appearance and
general demeanour were so martial and inspiring that an
old man in the crowd in a fit of enthusiasm shouted out :

" Bravo ! That's the sort we want !"

20



3o6 REMINISCENCES OF PRIVATE IVANOFF

Since which occasion the General has always been
known as '' Bravo."

He had ambitions. He carried several small volumes
on military history throughout the campaign. His
favourite topic of conversation with his officers was
criticism of the Napoleonic campaigns. I, of course, only
knew of this from hearsay, as we seldom saw our General.
Generally he caught us up midway in the day's march in
his carriage, drawn by a troika. Having arrived at the
quarters for the night, he would occupy a lodging and
stay there until late the next morning and again catch us
up during the day, w^hen the men would always remark
on the particular degree of purple in the face and the
hoarseness accompanying his deafening salute to us :

'' Health to you, Starobieltzi !"

" We wish Your Excellency health," the men would
reply, adding to themselves : " Old Bravo is off for
another booze."

And the General would go ahead, sometimes without
any incident, and sometimes bestowing en route a thun-
derous " head-washing " on some poor company com-
mander.

Noticing that the battalion had halted, the General
rushed at us and jumped out of his carriage as quickly as
his corpulency would admit. The Major went up to him.

" Wliat's this ? Why have you halted ? Who gave
you leave ?"

" Your Excellency, the road is under water, and a train
is expected shortly over the rails."

" Road under water ? Train ? Bosh ! You are mak-
ing old women of the men, teaching them to be molly-
coddles. Don't halt without orders ! Consider yourself,
sir, under arrest ..."

" Your Excellency ..."

*' Don't answer me !"

The General raised his eyes threateningly and turned
his attention on another victim.



REMINISCENCES OF PRIVATE IVANOFF 307

" Why, what's this ? Why is the commander of the
second rifle company not in his place ? Staff-Captain
Ventzel, come here, please !"

Ventzel went forward, and the General poured a torrent
of rage on him. I heard how Ventzel tried to reply,
raising his voice, but the General shouted him down, and
it was only possible to guess that Ventzel had said some-
thing disrespectful.

** You dare to reply ? To be impertinent ?" thun-
dered the General. " Hold your tongue ! Take his
sword from him. Go to the money-chest, under arrest !
An example to the men. . . . Afraid of water ! My men,
after me ! Remember Suvoroff !"

The General went rapidly past the battalion with the
cramped gait of one who has been sitting for a long time
in a carriage.

" Follow me ! Children ! Remember Suvoroff !" he
repeated, and waded in his patent-leather jack-boots
into the water. The Major, with a malicious expression
on his face, glanced back and went forward with the
General. The battalion moved after them. At first the
water was knee-high, then it reached the waist, then
higher and higher. The tall General moved freely, but
the little Major was already striking out with his arms.
The men, just like a flock of sheep when crossing a stream,
jostled each other and staggered from side to side as they
pulled their feet out of the soft clayey bottom in which
they kept sticking. The company commanders and
the battalion Adjutant, who were riding, and could have,
in consequence, crossed over very comfortably, seeing the
example set by the General, followed it, dismounted, and,
leading their horses, waded into the muddy water, which
had been churned up by hundreds of soldiers' feet. Our
company, composed of the tallest men in the battalion,
crossed with comparative comfort, but the eighth com-
pany, which was marching abreast of us, and was com-
posed of undersized men, were almost up to their ears in



3o8 REMINISCENCES OF PRIVATE IVANOFF

the water. Some of them even began to choke and clutch
at us. A little gipsy soldier, with blanched face and
terrified, wide-opened eyes, seized " Uncle " Jitkoff by
the neck with both hands, having thrown away his rifle.
Luckily for the gipsy, somebody seized it from going to
the bottom.

Ten sajenes farther on the water became shallower,
and everyone, being now out of danger, commenced to
scramble out as quickly as possible, pushing and swearing
at each other. Many of us laughed, but it was no laugh-
ing matter for the soldiers of the eighth company. Many
of their faces were blue not only from cold. Behind us
pressed the riflemen.

** Now then, whipper-snappers, scramble out ! They
have sunk !" they cried.

" Very easy to have drowned," replied the eighth com-
pany. " It was all right for him ; he only wetted his
whiskers. What a hero ! People could be drowned
here."

*' You should have sat in my canteen. I would have
taken you over dry."

" I didn't think of that," replied the little soldier good-
humouredly at the gibe.

The cause of all this bustle having already succeeded
in freeing his feet from the sticky bottom, and having got
out of the water, was standing in a majestic pose on the
bank, looking at the struggling mass of humanity in the
water. He was wet to the skin, and had in reality soaked
himself and his long whiskers. The w^ater was trickling
from his clothes. His polished leather top-boots were
bulging with water, but he continued to shout encourage-
ment to the men.

" Forward, my children ! Remember Suvoroff !"

The soaking officers with gloomy faces were crowd-
ing around him. Amongst them was Ventzel, with dis-
torted face, and minus his sword. Meanwhile the
General's coachman, having reached the bank, and



REMINISCENCES OF PRIVATE IVANOFF 309

having pushed off into the water, sat on the box
with a huge whip, and got over successfully, a little
to one side of the spot where he had crossed, and
where the water scarcely reached the axles of the
carriage-wheel.

" That is where, Your Excellency, we should have
crossed over," said the Major quietly. *' Will you order
the men to dry themselves ?"

" Certainly, certainly, Sergei Nicolaich," replied the
General calmly. The cold water had quenched his ardour.
He got into his carriage, sat down ; then again stood up
and cried out at the top of his extraordinarily powerful
voice :

" Thank you, Starobieltzi ! You are good fellows."

" Pleased to try. Your Excellency !" replied the men
in salute somewhat confusedly. And the dripping
General drove off ahead.

The sun was still high. There were only five more
versts to go, so the Major made a prolonged halt. We
undressed, lit fires, dried our clothes, boots, knapsacks,
and pouches, and two hours afterwards started off again,
even laughing at the recollection of our bath.

" And so old Bravo has sent Ventzel off under arrest !"
said Feodoroff.

'* A good job. Let him march a day or two with the
money-chest," came the reply from someone in the
riflemen company behind us.

" What's that to do with you ?"

" With me ! Not only with me, but for the whole
company it will be easier. At least we shall have a rest
for a couple of days. We can't stick him — that's what
it is to do with me !"

** Patience brings everything about."

" Patience is all right, but it doesn't always bring
everything," said Jitkoff in his usual surly tone. " If
only the Turk will kill him !"

" And you, ' Uncle' Jitkoff, don't despair. You have



310 REMINISCENCES OF PRIVATE IVANOFF

to think about our no longer being wet, that we are
marching dry, and old Bravo is riding wet," said
Feodoroff, amidst general laughter.



We continued to march parallel with the railway.
Trains filled with men, horses, and supplies were con-
tinually passing us. The men looked enviously at the
goods waggons being whirled past us, through the open
doors of which were to be seen horses' muzzles.

'* Eh ? But what luck for the horses ! Meanwhile we
have to walk."

" A horse is stupid, and gets thin," argued Vasili
Karpich. '' But you are a man, and can look after your-
self properly."

Once, when we were halted, a Cossack galloped up to
the Major with an important piece of news. We were
ordered to fall in without knapsacks or arms, just in our
vrhite shirts. None of us knew what this meant. The
officers examined us. Ventzel, as usual, was shouting
and swearing, tugging at badly-put-on belts, and with
kicks ordering men to adjust their shirts. Then they
marched us to the bed of the railway, and after a good
deal of manoeuvring, the regiment was stretched in two
ranks along the route. The line of white shirts extended
more than a verst.

*' Children," shouted the Major, " His Majesty the
Emperor is passing by !"

And we commenced to await the Emperor. Our
division was an outlying one, stationed far from Peters-
burg and Moscow. Barely one-tenth of the men com-
posing it had ever seen their Tsar, and all waited the
Imperial train impatiently. Half an hour passed by, and
no train. The men were allowed to sit down, and began
to talk.

" Will the train stop ?" asked someone.



REMINISCENCES OF PRIVATE IVANOFF 311

** Don't reckon on that ! Stopping for every regi-
ment ! He will look at us out of the window, and that's
good enough for us."

" And we shall not distinguish which is he. There are
a number of Generals with him."

" I shall know. The year before last I saw him at

K as close as that ; " and the soldier stretched out

his hand to show how close he had been to the Emperor.

Finally, after two hours' expectancy, smoke appeared
in the distance. The regiment rose and took up its
proper dressing. First passed the train with the servants
and kitchen. The cooks and their assistants in white
caps looked at us out of the windows, and for some
reason laughed. About 200 sajenes behind came the
Imperial train. The engine-driver, seeing the regiment
drawn up, slackened speed, and the carriages slowly
rumbled past before eyes greedily searching the windows.
But aU had the blinds drawn. A Cossack and an officer,
standing on the platform of the last carriage, were the
sole persons on the train whom we saw. We stood
gazing after the faster and faster receding train for another
three minutes, and then returned to our bivouac. The
men were disappointed, and expressed their disappoint-
ment.

*' When shall we ever see him now ?"

But we were soon to see him. They told us that the
Emperor would review us before the town of Ploeshti.

We marched past before him, as on the march, in the
same dirty white shirts and trousers, in the same browned
and dusty boots, with the same ugly strapped-on knap-
sacks, ration-bags, and bottles on string. The soldier had
nothing of the young dandy or dashing hero in appear-
ance. Each much more closely resembled a simple
common moujik. Only the rifle and ammunition-
pouches showed that this moujik was off to the war.
We were drawn up in columns of fours, as we could not
have marched through the narrow streets of the town in



312 REMINISCENCES OF PRIVATE IVANOFF

any other formation. I marched by the side, and tried
above all not to get out of step and to keep my dressing,
and reflected that if the Emperor and his suite chanced
to be standing on my side, I should pass close to him,
right under his eyes. Chancing to glance at Jitkoff
marching abreast of me, at his face, as always, severe and
sombre, but now flushed, I became infected with the
general excitement, and my heart beat quicker, and I
suddenly felt that it all depended on us as to how the
Emperor regarded us. I felt much the same sort of sen-
sation the first time I came under fire.

The men marched faster and faster, the pace became
longer and the gait freer and more firm. There was no
need for me to adapt myself to the general pace. All
tiredness had vanished just as if we had all grown wings
which were bearing us forward to that point whence
already we could hear the crash of bands and deafening
hurrahs. I don't remember the streets through which
we passed, nor the people in them, or whether they looked
at us. I remember only the excitement which possessed
me, and the consciousness of the compelling, tremendous
strength of the mass of which I was a member. One
felt that nothing was impossible for this mass, that the
torrent of which I was a struggling component part could
know no obstacle, but could smash, extirpate, destroy
all in its path, and each one thougth that He, past whom
this torrent was streaming, could, with one word, by one
wave of the hand, alter its courses, turn it back, or again
hurl it at terrifying obstacles. Each one wished to find
in the word of this one man, and in the movement of his
hand, the unknown something which was sending us to
death. *' Thou art sending us " — each one thought —
*' and we are giving thee our lives. Look at us and rest
assured. We are ready to die."

And He knew we were ready to die for him. He saw
the terrifying rows of determined men V\-hich were passing
him almost at the double, the men of his own poor



REMINISCENCES OF PRIVATE IVANOFF 313

country, poorly clad, simple soldiers, they were all going
to death calm and free of responsibility.

He was sitting on a grey horse which stood motionless
with ears pricked alert at the music and the mad, en-
thusiastic shouts. A brilliant suite was round him.
But I do not remember any of the brilliant crowd of
horsemen excepting that one man on a grey horse in
simple uniform and white cap. I remember his pale
worn face — worn with the consciousness of the weighty
decision taken. I remember how tears like big raindrops
were running down his cheeks, falling on the dark cloth
of his uniform in bright glistening splashes. I remember
the trembling lips murmuring something which was
doubtless a welcome to the thousands of young lives
about to perish and for whom he was weeping. All this
appeared and disappeared, lighted up with the rapidity
of lightning, as I, breathless, not from running, but from
mad, delirious enthusiasm, doubled past him with rifle
raised high in one hand, and with the other waving my
cap above my head, yelling a deafening hurrah, which,
however, I could not even hear in the general roar.

AU this flashed up and disappeared. The dusty streets
bathed in a scorching heat, the exhausting excitement,
the soldiers worn out by excitement and from having
doubled for a distance of nearly one verst under a baking
sun. The shouts of the officers calling on the men to
keep formation and in step — that is all I saw and heard
five minutes later.

After we had marched a further two versts through the
stifling town and reached the common on which we were
to bivouac, I threw myself to the ground, utterly worn
out, body and soul.

VI

Difficult marches, dust, heat, fatigue, bleeding feet'
brief halts by day, deathlike slumber by night, the hated
bugle waking us at scarce dawn, and all the time fields —



314 REMINISCENCES OF PRIVATE IVANOFF

fields. Not like those in our own country, but covered
with high, green, loudly-rustling, long, silky leaves of
maize or wheat, already in places turning yellow.

The same faces, the same regimental life, the same
topics of conversation and tales of home, of the halt in
the provincial town, and criticisms of the officers.

Of the future we seldom and unwillingly spoke. We
only knew vaguely that we were going to war, notwith-
standing the fact that we had halted not far from Kishineff
for a whole six months, although quite ready to march.
It would have been possible during that time to have
explained why we were preparing for war, but I suppose
it was not considered necessary. I remember a soldier
one day asked me :

" Vladimir Mikhailich, shall we soon arrive in Bokhara ?"

I thought at first that I had not heard correctly, but
when he repeated the question I replied that Bokhara
was beyond two seas, four thousand versts away, and we
v/ere never likely to get there.

'' No, Mikhailich, don't talk like that. One of the
regimental clerks has told me. He says that we shall
cross the Danube, and then we shall be in Bokhara."

" Not Bokhara — Bulgaria !" I exclaimed.

** Well, Bokhara or Bulgaria, whichever you call it,
isn't it all the same ?"

And he said no more, evidently dissatisfied.

We only knew that we were going to kill the Turk
because he had shed much blood. And we wanted to kill
him, not so much for the blood he had shed of persons
not known to us, but because he had upset so many
people that, through it, we were forced to experience a
hard campaign (" for which we are going a thousand
versts to him, the unclean beast !"). Those on furlough
and reservists were obliged to leave home and family,
and all go together somewhere under shell and bullet.
The Turk was pictured as a rioter and ringleader, whom
it was necessary to pacify and subdue.



REMINISCENCES OF PRIVATE IVANOFF 315

We occupied ourselves much more with our family,
battalion, and company affairs than in the war. In our
company all was quiet and peaceful. But matters went
from bad to worse with the rifle company. Ventzel did
not grow more sensible. Secret indignation grew, and
after one incident, which, even now, five years after-
wards, I cannot remember without becoming worked up,
it developed into regular hatred.

We had just passed through a town, and had come
out on to a field where the first regiment, marching ahead
of us, had already pitched its tents. The camp was a
good one. On one side was a river, on the other an old
clean oak grove, probably a resort of the local inhabi-
tants. It was a nice warm evening. The sun was setting.
We halted and piled arms. I and Jitkoff began to pitch
our shelter. We had fixed up the supports. I was
holding one edge of the sheet, and Jitkoff was hammering
in a peg with a stick.

'' Tighter, hold it tighter, Mikhailich." (He had for
some days past commenced to address me in this intimate
way.) " There, that's right."

But at this moment from behind us there came some
strange measured smacking sounds. I turned round.

The riflemen were standing in line. Ventzel, shouting
out something hoarsely, was hitting one of the soldiers
in the face. The man, with a face pale as death, holding
his rifle at the order and not daring to avoid the blows,
was trembling all over. Ventzel' s thin, small body
swayed with the force of the blows he was dealing with
both hands, first the right and then the left. Everyone
around was silent — only the smack was heard and the
hoarse muttering of the infuriated commander. Every-
thing went dark, and began to swim before me. I made
a movement. Jitkoff understood it, and tugged with all
his strength at the tent sheet.

" Hang on to it, d n you, you awkward " he

shouted, showering the most abusive epithets on me.



3i6 REMIiNISCENCES OF PRIVATE IVANOFF

" Have your hands withered or what ? Where are you
looking ? Have you never seen it before ?"

The blows continued to resound. Blood was trickling
from the man's upper lip and chin. At last he fell,
Ventzel turned round, and glaring full at the whole
company, shouted :

" If anyone else dares to smoke, I will treat the black-
guard worse. Lift him up, wash his ugly face, and put
him in the tent. Let him lie there. Pile arms !" he
commanded.

His hands Vv-ere trembling, red, swollen, and covered
with blood. He took out a handkerchief, wiped his
hands, and left the men, who had piled their arms and
were dangerously silent. Several of them, muttering
amongst themselves, collected around the bruised victim,
and raised him. Ventzel was walking with a nervous,
worn-out gait. He was pale and his eyes glistened. The
twitching of his muscles told how hard his teeth were set.
He went past us, and, meeting my searching look, he
smiled with his thin lips, only in an unnatural, derisive
manner, and, muttering something, went on.

** Bloodsucker !" said Jitkoff, with hatred in his voice.
*' And you too, sir. . . . What did you want to go there
for ? Do you want to be shot ? Wait a little, and they
will get even with him."

" Will they complain ?" I asked. " If so, to whom ?"

" No, there will be no complaint. We also will do
something."

And he muttered something almost to himself. I
dared not understand him. Feodoroff, who had already
been amongst the riflemen and asked what it was all
about, came back to us.

" He bullies the m.en without any reason," he said.
*' This little soldier, Matushkin, was smoking on the
march. When they halted he ordered his rifle, keeping
the cigarette between his fingers. Evidently, and un-
luckily for him, he forgot all about it. ' But Ventzel



REMINISCENCES OF PRIVATE IVANOFF 317

noticed it. Brute, beast !" he added sorrowfully, laying
himself down in the tent, which was now ready. " The
cigarette was out. It's quite clear the poor beggar had
forgotten."

In the course of a few days we marched into Alexandria,
where an enormous number of troops had collected.
Whilst still coming down the high mountain, we saw an
enormous expanse dotted with white tents and the black
figures of men, long horse lines and glistening rows of
guns with their green carriages and limbers. Whole
crowds of officers and men were wandering through the
streets of the town. Lugubrious, mournful Hungarian
music, mingling with the clatter of dishes and loud con-
versation, came from the open windows of crowded and
dirty hotels. The little shops were crammed with Russian
purchasers. Our soldiers, Roumanians, foreigners, and
Jews shouted loudly at each other, without making
themselves understood. Quarrels as to the rate of ex-
change on the paper rouble could be heard at every step.

*' Where is the Post-Office ?" with exaggerated cour-
tesy and touching the peak of his kepi with his hand,
inquires of a smartly - dressed Roumanian an officer
equipped with a " Soldier's Translator," a little book
with which the troops had been supplied. The Rou-
manian explains. The officer turns over the pages of
the book, looking for a translation of the unintelligible
words, and understands nothing, but still thanks him
politely. " Tfy, you comrades ! What a people ! Our
priests and our churches, and yet you can't understand
a word !"

" Will you take a silver rouble for this ?" a soldier
shouts at the top of his voice, holding up a shirt in his
hands to a Roumanian trading at an open stall. " How
much for the shirt ? Five francs ? Four francs ?"

He draws out the money, shows it, and the business
ends in mutual satisfaction.

" Make way, make way, chums, the General's coming."



3i8 REMINISCENCES OF PRIVATE IVANOFF

A tall, young-looking General, in a smart jacket and
high boots, with a cossack whip hanging by its lash over
his shoulder, came rapidly along the street. Several
paces behind him was an orderly, a little Asiatic in a
coloured robe and turban, with an enormous sword and
a revolver at his belt. The General, holding his head
well up, and with good-natured indifference looking at
the men as they saluted and made way for him, passed
into an hotel. Here I, Ivan Platonich, and Stebelkoff
were ensconced in a comer swallowing down some local
dish composed of red pepper and meat. The dilapidated
room, laid out with little tables, was full of people. The
clatter of dishes, the popping of corks, and the hum of
sober and drunken voices, were all hidden by the orchestra,
which was seated in a kind of alcove decorated with
red stuff curtains. There were five musicians. Two
violins were scraping away furiously. A 'cello was boom-
ing on two or three notes, whilst a double-bass roared.
But all these instruments merely formed an accompani-
ment for a fifth. A swarthy, curly-haired Hungarian,
almost a boy, sat in front of all. From inside the wide
velvet collar of his coat there projected a strange-looking
instrument, a wooden flute of the precise pattern that
Pan and the Fauns are always depicted as playing. It
consisted of a row of uneven wooden pipes, so fastened
together that their open ends rested against the lips of
the artist. The Hungarian, turning his head first to one
side then to another, blew into these pipes, producing
powerful, melodious sounds, not unlike those of a flute
or clarionet. He executed the most tricky and difficult
passages by shaking and turning his head. His black
greasy locks danced on his head and fell over his forehead.
His red face was covered with perspiration, and the veins
stood out on his neck. It was evidently a difficult job. . . .
Against the discordant accompaniment of the stringed
instruments, the sound of the pan-pipes stood out sharply,
clearly, and wildly beautiful.



REMINISCENCES OF PRIVATE IVANOFF 319

The General took his place at a table around which
were some officers knowTi to him, bowed to all who had
risen at his entry, and loudly said, '* Be seated, gentle-
men," which applied to the rank and file present. We
finished our dinner in silence. Ivan Platonich ordered a
bottle of red Roumanian wine, and after the second bottle,
when his face had taken on a jovial expression and his
cheeks and nose had become brightly tinted, he turned
to me :

" You, young man, tell me. . . . Do you remember
when we had the big halt ?"

" I do, Ivan Platonich."

*' Did you speak with Ventzel then ?"

" I did."

*' Did you seize him by the arm ?" inquired the Captain,
in a pretematurally solemn tone. And when I replied I
had done so he gave a prolonged deep sigh and began to
blink in an agitated manner.

'' You did wrong . . . you acted stupidly. Look here,
I don't want to reprimand you. You did very well . . .
that is, it was contrary to all discipline. . . . Oh, damn it !
what am I saying ? You will excuse me. ..."

He remained silent, gazing at the floor and breathing
heavily. I also was silent. Ivan Platonich gulped down
half a glass and then smacked me on the knee.

'* Give me a promise that you will not do such a thing
again. I quite understand. ... It is difficult for a new-
comer. But what good can you do by it ? He is such
a mad dog, this Ventzel. WeU, look here. ..."

Ivan Platonich evidently could not find the right word,
and after a long pause again had recourse to his glass.

" That is . . . you see . . . he is a good chap really. It
is a kind of . . . deuce knows what — a kind of madness of
his. You yourself saw how I, too, knocked one of the
men about a little not long ago. But if the idiot won't
understand his mistakes. , . . You know he is such a

to them. I swear I have no malice against them, even
though I do flare up sometimes. But as for Ventzel, it
has got into his system. Hey, you !" — he shouted to one
of the Roumanian waiters — " another bottle. . . . And
some day he will be court-martialled or even worse. The
men will get revengeful, and the first time under fire. . . .
It will be a pity, because all the same he is a good man,
as you know. And even a warm-hearted fellow."

" What !" Stebelkoff exclaimed. " What warm-
hearted man would act like he does ?"

** You should have seen, Ivan Platonich, what your
warm-hearted man did the other day."

And I told the Captain how Ventzel had knocked about
one of the men for smoking in the ranks.

" There you are, there you are. ..."

Ivan Platonich turned red, puffed, stopped short, and
again commenced to talk. " But for all that he is not a
beast. Whose men are best fed ? Ventzel's. Which are
the best-trained men ? Ventzel's. In which company
are there practically no fines ? Who never sends his men
up for court-martial, unless a man does something very
bad ? Always Ventzel. If it were not for this unhappy
weakness of his the men would carry him shoulder high."

" Have you spoken about it to him, Ivan Platonich ?"

" I have spoken and argued a dozen times. What can
you do with him ? ' Either they are soldiers or militia, '
he says. Those are the silly kind of speeches he makes.
* War,* says he, * is so cruel that even if I am cruel with
the men it is but a drop in the ocean. . . .' * They,' he
says, * are in such a low state of development. . . .' In a
word, the deuce knows what he doesn't say.'l All the same
he is an excellent chap. He doesn't drink or play cards.
He is a conscientious soldier, helps his old father and a
sister, and is a splendid companion. Moreover, he is the
best-read man in the regiment. And mark my word, he
will either be court-martialled, or they " — he nodded his
head towards the window — " will deal with him. It's a



REMINISCENCES OF PRIVATE IVANOFF 321

bad job. And that's how the matter stands, my most
worthy trooper."

Ivan Platonich gave me a kindly pat on my shoulder-
strap and then dived his hand into his pocket, brought
out a tobacco-pouch, and commenced to roll a gigantic
cigarette, which he stuck into an enormous amber mouth-
piece on which was the inscription ** Caucasus " in oxidized
silver. Sticking the holder into his mouth, he silently
pushed the pouch towards me. We were all three smok-
ing, and the Captain recommenced :

'' Sometimes it is impossible not to hit them. They
are really like children. Do you know Balunoff ?"

Stebelkoff suddenly burst out laughing.

" Well, what's the matter, Stebelkoff ?" grunted Ivan
Platonich. '* Balunoff is an old soldier who has often
been punished. He has served twenty years, and yet
they will not let him go on account of his various offences.
Well, this rascal once . . . You weren't with us then.
When we were leaving a village near Kishineff an order
was given to inspect all the extra pairs of boots. I drew
the men up in line, and walking behind them to see if
any of the boot-tops were sticking out of the knapsacks,
saw that Balunoff had none. 'Where are your boots ?'
' I have put them inside my knapsack for safety,
sir.' * That's a lie.' 'Not at all, sir. They are in
my knapsack so as not to g&amp;i wet,' the blackguard
replied.

" ' Take off your knapsack and open it. I noticed he
didn't open it, but dragged the tops of the boots from
under the cover.

" ' Open it.' 'I can take them out without opening it,
sir.' "

" However, I made him open the knapsack, and what
do you think ? He dragged a live sucking-pig by the
ears out of it. Its snout was tied up with string so that
it shouldn't squeak. With his right hand at the salute
he stood and grinned, and with his left hand held the pig.



322 REMINISCENCES OF PRIVATE IVANOFF

He had stolen it, the rascal, from the Moldavians. Well,
of course I hit him, but not hard."

Stebelkoff roared with laughter, and, scarcely able to
speak, said : '' Yes . . . and do you know, Ivanoff, what
he hit him with ? . . . With the pig !"

" Yes, but couldn't you have avoided that, Ivan
Platonich ?"

" Oh you ! Upon my word, it makes me tired to listen
to you. I couldn't court-martial him for it, could I ?"



VII

On the night of the 14 th to 15 th of June Feodoroff woke me.

" Mikhailich, do you hear ?"

" What is it ?"

'' Firing. They are crossing the Danube."

I began to listen. A strong wind was blowing, driving
before it lowering black clouds which hid the moon. It
blew against the canvas of our tents, making them flap,
whistled through the guy-ropes, and made a faint sighing
sound through the piles of arms. Through these sounds
could be heard occasional deep reports.

" Many are being killed now," whispered Feodoroff with
a sigh. " Will they order us forward or not ? What do
you think ? It sounds like thunder."

" Perhaps it is only a thunderstorm ?"

"No, it is so regular. Listen, do you hear them one
after another ?"

The booming was certainly very regular in its intervals.
I crawled out of the tent and gazed in the direction of the
sounds. No flashes of flame were visible. Sometimes a
light appeared to be visible to the straining eyes in the
direction whence the reports were coming, but it was only
fancy.

At last it has come, I thought.

And I tried to picture to myself what was happening
in the darkness there. I imagined a wide black river with



REMINISCENCES OF PRIVATE IVANOFF 323

precipitous banks, utterly unlike the real Danube as I
afterwards saw it. Hundreds of boats are crossing.
These measured, frequent shots are at them. Will many
of them escape ? A cold shiver ran down my back.
" Would I like to be there ?" I asked myself involuntarily.

I gazed at the sleeping camp. All was quiet. In the
intervals between the distant thunder of guns and the
noise of the wind could be heard the heavy breathing of
the men. And I had a sudden passionate longing that all
this should not take place, that the march should
continue, that all these soundly sleeping men and with
them myself should not be obliged to go where the firing
was taking place.

Sometimes the cannonade became heavier. Sometimes
I heard confusedly a less loud deep noise. They are
firing volleys, I thought, not knowing that we were still
twenty versts from the Danube and that a painfully
strained imagination was creating these sounds. But
though imaginary, they roused, nevertheless, quickened
fancy, causing it to picture fearful scenes. In imagination
I heard the cries and groans, I saw thousands of human
beings falling, and heard the desperate hoarse hurrahs.
I pictured the bayonet charge, the carnage. And if beaten
oft, it will all be for nothing !

Grey dawn commenced in the dark east. The wind
began to die away. The clouds parted, disclosing stars
waning in the paling heavens. It grew lighter. Some-
body in the camp awoke and, hearing the sounds of battle,
aroused the others. They spoke little and quietly. The
unknown had approached closely to us. No one knew
what the morrow would bring. No one cared to think or
speak of it.

I slept until daylight and awoke rather late. The
cannon continued to rumble deeply, and, although no
news had come from the Danube, there were rumours
amongst us, each one more improbable than the other.
Some said that we had already crossed and were pursuing



324 REMINISCENCES OF PRIVATE IVANOFF

the Turks, others said the attempt to cross had failed and
whole regiments had been destroyed.

'* Some had been drowned, others had been shot," said
someone.

" And you are lying," interrupted Vassili Karpich.

" Why am I lying, if it is true ?"

" True ! Who told you ?"

" What ?"

" The truth ? Where did you hear it ?"

** We all know. The firing goes on and nothing more."

" All say it. A Cossack has been to the General,
and . . ."

*' Cossack ! Did you see him ? What is he like, this
Cossack ?"

*' An ordinary Cossack . . . just as he ought to look."

" As he ought to ! What a tongue you have got —
just like an old woman. Better to keep your mouth shut.
No one has been, so no one could know."

I went to Ivan Platonich. The officers were sitting
fully equipped and ready, with their revolvers fastened
to their waist-belts. Ivan Platonich, as usual, was red,
puffing, and breathing heavily, and was wiping [his neck
with a dirty handkerchief. Stebelkoff was excited, bright,
and for some reason had pomaded his usually drooping
moustaches so that they stuck out in pointed ends.

" Look at our Lieutenant ! He has got himself up for
action," said Ivan Platonich, winking at him. " Ah, my
dear chap, I am sorry for you. We shall have no such
moustaches in our mess ! They will do for you, Stebel-
koff," said the Captain jokingly. *' Well, you are not
afraid ?"

" I shall try not to be," said Stebelkoff in a brave
voice.

" Well, and you, you warrior, is it terrifying ?"

" I don't know, Ivan Platonich. . . . Has nothing been
heard from there ?"

" Nothing. The Lord only knows what is happening



REMINISCENCES OF PRIVATE IVANOFF 325

there." Ivan Platonich sighed deeply. *' We move off
in an hour's time," he added after a short pause.

The fly of the tent opened, and the Adjutant Lukin
poked his head in. He looked very serious and pale.

" You here, Ivanoff ? Orders have been given to swear
you in. . . . Not now, but when we move off. Ivan
Platonich, a fifth packet of cartridges to the men."

He refused to come in and sit down, saying that he had
much to do, and went off somewhere. I also left.

About twelve o'clock dinners were served. The men
ate little. After dinner we were ordered to remove our
sight-protectors (leather covers) from our rifles ana extra
ammunition was issued. The men began to prepare for
action. They commenced to examine their knapsacks
and throw away anything superfluous. Tom shirts and
drawers, various kinds of rags, old boots, brushes, greasy
handbooks — all were thrown away. Some of the men
appeared to have brought a quantity of useless things in
their knapsacks as far as the Danube. I saw a " schelkun "
— a small piece of wood used in time of peace before
parades and reviews for polishing kit-straps — lying on the
ground, heavy stone pomade jars, all sorts of small boxes
and bits of boards, and even a whole boot-tree.

" Go on ; throw away. It will be easier marching. We
shall not want them to-morrow."

" Five hundred versts I have carried you . . . and what
for ?" argued Lutikoff, examining some rag. *' I can't
take you with me."

It became the fashion that day to throw away things
and to clean out knapsacks. When v/e left the camp it
showed up in the dark background of the Steppe as a
quadrangular space dotted Math multi-coloured rags and
other articles.

Before marching, when the regiment was already
standing waiting the word of command, several officers
and our young regimental chaplain collected in front. I
was called out of the ranks with four " volunteers " from



326 REMINISCENCES OF PRIVATE IVANOFF

other regiments. All had enlisted for the campaign.
Having handed over our rifles to neighbours, we went
forward and stood near the colours. My unknown com-
rades were in a state of agitation, and I, too, felt my heart
beating faster than usual.

" Take hold of the colours," said the battalion com-
mandant. The colour-bearer lowered the colour and
others of the colour-party removed the case. An old
faded green silk fabric unfolded to the wind. We stood
around it, and, grasping the pole with one hand and
holding the other aloft, we repeated the words of the
chaplain, as he read out the ancient military oath of
Peter's time. They recalled to me what Vassili Karpich
had said on our: first march. Where does it come in ?
thought I, and after a long list of the occasions and places
on and in which His Imperial Majesty had served, I heard
these words : " Do not spare your life." We five all
repeated them in one voice, and, glancing at the rows of
gloomy men ready for action, I felt that they were no
empty words.

We returned to our places. The regiment stirred, and
dissolving into a long column, set off with forced step
for the Danube. The firing which we had heard had now
ceased.

:{( ^ :{: H: ^

As through a dream I remember that march. The dust
raised by the horses of Cossack regiments as they overtook
us, the broad steppes sloping down to the Danube, the op-
posite bank showing up blue, fifteen versts away. The
fatigue, heat, and the jostling and fighting at the wells
under Zimnitza. The dirty little town filled with troops,
some Generals who waved their caps at us from a balcony
and shouted " Hurrah !" to which we replied.

" They have crossed ! The}^ are over !" buzzed voices
around us.

" Two hundred killed, five hundred wounded."



REMINISCENCES OF PRIVATE IVANOFF 327



VIII

It was already dark when, having come down from the
bank, we crossed a tributary of the Danube by a small
bridge, and marched over a low sandy island still wet
from the water which had but just receded from it. I
remember the sharp clank of the bayonets of the soldiers
as the men collided with each other in the darkness, the
deep rumble of the artillery which had overtaken us, the
black expanse of the wide river, the lights on the other
bank, where we had to cross to-morrow, and where, I
reflected, to-morrow would be a fresh battle. . . . Better
not to think, better to sleep, I decided, and laid down on
the watery sand.

The sun was already high when I opened my eyes.
Troops, transport, and parks were swarming over the
sandy shore. At the very edge of the water they had
already dug out gun-pits and trenches for the riflemen.
Across the Danube, on its steep cliff could be discerned
gardens and vineyards in which our troops swarmed.
Behind these the land rose higher and higher, abruptly
restricting the horizon. To the right, three versts from
us, and showing white on the hills, were the houses and
minarets of Sistovo. A steamer with a barge in tow was
transferring battalion after battalion to the other side.
On our side a little torpedo-boat was noisily blowing off
steam.

" A successful crossing, Vladimir Mikhailich," said
Feodoroff to me gaily.

" The same to you. Only we have not crossed yet."

" We shaU directly. Look ; the steamer will soon take
us over. They say a Turkish ironclad is not far away.
This little samovar is ready for it." He pointed to the
torpedo-boat.

*' Great God ! but what a number have been killed," he
continued, changing his tone. ** They are already bring-
ing and bringing them over from that side. ..."



328 REMINISCENCES OF PRIVATE IVANOFF

And he related to me the well-known details of the
Battle of Sistovo.

** Now it is our turn. We chaU cross over to that
side. . . . The Turks will attack us. . . . Well, anyhow,
we have had a respite. We at least are alive, but those
there ..." He nodded his head to a group of men and
officers standing not far from us, who were crowded round
some object not visible to us at which they were all
gazing.

" What is it ?"

"They have brought over our kiUed. Go and look,
Mikhailich. How terrible !"

I went up to the group. All were silent, and with heads
bared were gazing at the bodies lying side by side on the
sand. Ivan Platonich, Stebelkoff, and Ventzel were also
there. Ivan Platonich was frowning angrily, clearing his
throat and breathing heavily. Stebelkoff, with frank
horror, was stretching out his thin neck. Ventzel was
standing wrapped in thought.

There were two of them lying on the sand. One was
a fuU-grown, handsome Guardsman of the Finland
Regiment, from the Composite Guards half-company —
the same half-company which had lost half its strength
during the attack. He had been wounded in the stomach,
and must have suffered long agonies before he died.
Suffering had left a faint imxpression of something spiritual,
had left a shadow of refinement and something painfully
tender on his face. His eyes were closed, and his arms
were crossed on his chest. Had he himself adopted this
position before death, or had his comrade tended him ?
His appearance did not excite terror or revulsion, but only
infinite pity for the life so full of energy which had
perished.

Ivan Platonich bent over the body and taking up the
man's cap lying near the head, read on the peak, " Ivan
Jurenko, 3rd Company." " The poor chap was a Little
Russian," he said quietly. It recalled to me my birth-



REMINISCENCES OF PRIVATE IVANOFF 329

place, the warm wind of the Steppe, the village nestling
in the ravine, the gullies, the overgrowTi willows, the
little white mud hut with its red shutters. . . . Who is
waiting you there ?

The other was a linesman of the Volhynia Regiment.
Death had taken him suddenly. He was running madly
to the attack, breathless from shouting. The bullet had
struck the bridge of his nose and had penetrated into his
head, leaving a black gaping wound. He lay with wide-
opened eyes, now dimmed, with gaping mouth, and face
already discoloured, but still distorted with rage.

" They have paid their accounts," said Ivan Platonich ;
" they are in peace and want nothing more."

He turned away. The soldiers hurriedly parted to let
him through. I and Stebelkoff followed him. Ventzel
caught us up.

" WeU, Ivanoff," he said, " did you see ?"

" I have seen, Peter Nicolaievitch," I replied.

" And what did you think as you looked at them ?" he
inquired moodily.

A sudden rage rose within me against this man and a
mad desire to say something hard to him.

** Much. And most of all I thought that they were
no longer ' food for powder,' that they no longer needed
welding and discipline, and that nobody would now bully
them for the sake of this welding. I thought that they
are no longer soldiers, no longer subordinates," I said in
a trembling voice — '* they are men !"

VentzeFs eyes flashed, A sound came from his throat
and broke off. No doubt he wished to answer me, but
once more restrained himself. He walked by my side
with lowered head, and after taking a few paces, not
looking at me, said :

" Yes, Ivanoff, you are right. . . . They are men. . . .
Dead men."

They took us across the Danube. For some days we
halted near Sistovo awaiting the Turks. Then the troops
started off into the heart of the country. We, too,
started off. For a long time they sent us first here, then
there. We were near Timova and not far from Plevna.
Three weeks passed by, and still we had not been in action.
At length we were told off to form part of a special division
whose duties were to hold the advance of a large Turkish
army. Forty thousand were stretched over seventy
versts of country. There were about one hundred thou-
sand Turks in front of us, and only the cautious move-
ments of our commander — ^who would not risk his men but
contented himself by opposing the advance of the enemy —
and the dilatoriness of the Turkish Pacha enabled us to
carry out our task — not to allow the Turks to break
through and cut off our main army from the Danube.

We were few and our line was enormous ; consequently
we were seldom able to have a rest. We marched round
numbers of villages, appearing first in one place, then in
another, in order to meet the anticipated attack. We
penetrated into such remote parts of Bulgaria that the
transport with food did not find us, and we were obliged
to starve, making our two days' ration of biscuit last over
five and more days. The hungry men used to thresh
unripe wheat with sticks on outstretched sheets of our
tents, and made a disgusting soup from it and sour wild
apples, without salt (because we could not get any), and
got sick from it. Battalions faded away, although not
in action.

In the middle of June our brigade, with several squadrons
of cavalry and two batteries of artillery, arrived at a
ruined and half-burned Turkish village which had been
abandoned by its inhabitants. Our camp was situated
on a high, precipitous mountain. The village was below,
in the depth of the valley along which a little river wound



REMINISCENCES OF PRIVATE IVANOFF 331

its course. Steep, high cliffs rose on the other side of the
valley. It was, as we imagined, the Turkish side, but no
Turks were, as a matter of fact, near us. We camped
several days on our mountain, almost without bread,
only obtaining with great difficulty any water, as it was
necessary to descend far below for it to a spring which
came out at the bottom of the cliff. We were absolutely
detached from the army, and did not know in the least
what was going on in the world. Fifteen versts in front
of us were Cossack patrols. Two or three sotnias of them
were distributed over a distance of twenty versts. There
were no Turks there either.

Notwithstanding the fact that we could not find the
enemy, our little column took every precautionary
measure. Day and night a strong chain of advanced
posts surrounded the camp. Owing to the nature of the
ground its line was a long one, and every day several
companies were told off for this inactive but very tiring
work. Inaction, almost constant starvation, and ignor-
ance of the state of affairs acted prejudicially on the
men.

The regimental hospitals became overflowing. Each
day men, weakened and tortured by fever and dysentery,
were sent to the divisional hospital. The companies were
only one-half or two-thirds of their proper strength. All
were gloomy, and everyone longed to come to grips.
Anyhow, it would have been a change.

At length it came. A Cossack orderly came galloping
in from the commander of a Cossack squadron with the
information that the Turks had begun to advance and
that he had been compelled to call in his men and fall
back five versts. Afterwards it appeared that the Turks
went back without thinking of continuing the attack, and
we could have quietly remained on the spot, the more so
as nobody had ordered us to advance. But the General
commanding us then, who had but recently arrived from
St. Petersburg, felt, as did all of us in the column, that



332 REMINISCENCES OF PRIVATE IVANOFF

it was insufferable to the men to sit with folded arms or
stand for whole days on guard against an invisible and,
as all were convinced, non-existent enemy, to eat horrible
food, and aw^ait their turn to fall sick. All were eager
for the fray ; and the General ordered an attack.

We left half the column in camp. The situation was so
little known that there was a possibility of being attacked
from both sides. Fourteen companies, the Hussars, and
four guns moved out after midday. Never had we
marched so fast and light-heartedly, with the exception
of the day on which we marched past the Emperor.

We marched along the valley, passing, one after another,
deserted Turkish and Bulgarian villages. In the narrow
thoroughfares bordered by hedges higher than a man
nothing was to be met — neither human beings, cattle, nor
dogs. Only clucking hens flew away on our approach, on
to the hedges and roofs, and geese, with a cry, raised
themselves ponderously in the air and endeavoured to
fly away. In the gardens could be seen plum-trees of
every description, the branches of which were literally
obscured by ripe fruit. In the last village, five versts
from the spot we imagined the Turks to be in, we halted
for half an hour. During this spell the half-starved men
shook down quantities of plums, ate them, and crammed
their ration bags with them. A few would catch and
kill the hens and geese, pluck them, and bring them
along in their knapsacks. I remembered how the same
soldiers before the crossing at Sistovo, in anticipation of
a fight, had throv/n everything out of their knapsacks,
and I mentioned it to Jitkoff, who was at the moment
busily engaged in plucking an enormous goose.

** WeU, Mikhailich, although we have not been in action
we have become accustomed to wait. It seems as if you will
only march and not take any part in the fighting. And
even if you do you need not necessarily be killed."

** Are you frightened ?" I asked him involuntarily.

*' But perhaps nothing will happen," he answered



REMINISCENCES OF PRIVATE IVANOFF 333

slowly, frowning, and assiduously plucking out the last
remnants of white down.

" But if it does V

" li it does, frightened or not frightened, its all the
same, one has to go. They don't ask us. Go, and God
help you. Lend me your knife. It is such a good one."
I gave him my big hunting-knife. He cut the goose in
two, and held out one half to me.

" Take it in case. And about being frightened or not
frightened, don't think of it, sir. It is better not to think
of it. All rests with God. You cannot get away from
what He designs."

" If a bullet or shell comes at you, where can you go ?"
added Feodoroff, who was lying near us. " I think this,
Vladimir Mikhailich, that it is even more dangerous to run
away, because a bullet must travel like that " — he showed
with his finger — " and the heaviest fire comes from the
rear."

*' Yes," said I, " especially with the Turks. They say
they fire high."

" Well, clever one," said Jitkoff to Feodoroff, "go on
talking. There they will show you a trajectory. Yes, cer-
tainly," he added, thinking, "it is better to be in front."

" It depends on our officers," said Feodoroff, " and our
officer will go ahead and not be afraid."

" Yes, he will go ahead all right. He isn't afraid.
And Niemtseff also."

" ' Uncle ' Jitkoff," inquired Feodoroff, " what do you
say ? Will he live through the day or not ?"

Jitkoff lowered his eyes.

" What are you talking about ?" he asked.

" Well I never ! Have you seen him ? Every nerve is
on the go."

Jitkoff became still more surly.

" You are talking rot," he growled.

" Well. What did they say before we crossed the
Danube ?" said Feodoroff.



334 REMINISCENCES OF PRIVATE IVANOFF

" Before we crossed the Danube ! . . . The men were
angry then, and didn't know what they were saying. It's
a fact that they couldn't stand him."

" What do you think ? That they are blackguards ?"
said Jitkoff, turning and looking Feodoroff straight in the
face. ** Have they no thought of God in them ? They
do not know where they are going ! Perhaps some will
to-day have to answer to the Lord God, and can they
think of such a thing at such a moment ? Before the
crossing of the Danube ! Yes, I too then said the same
thing to the gentleman" (he nodded his head at me).
** I said exactly the same thing because ... it was sickening
to look at. It's not worth while remembering what hap-
pened before we crossed the Danube."

He felt in his boot-top for his tobacco-pouch, and, con-
tinuing to mutter, filled his pipe and commenced to
smoke. Then, replacing the pouch, he settled himself
more comfortably, seized his knees with his hands, and
became buried in some moody reflections.

Half an hour later we left the village and began to
clamber up from the valley into the mountains. The
Turks were behind the ridges, over which we were to cross.
When we reached the summit there opened out before
us a wide, hilly and gradually descending expanse, covered
here with fields of wheat and maize, there with overgrown
bushes and medlar-trees. In two places glistened the
minarets of villages hidden behind the green hills. We
were to take the one on the right. Behind it, on the
edge of the horizon, could be seen a whitish streak. It
was the main road which had been previously held by our
Cossacks. Soon all this became lost to sight. We en-
tered into a dense undergrowth intersected at intervals by
small fields.

I don't remember much about the commencement of
the battle. When we came out into the open on the
summit of a hill the Turks could plainly be seen. As our
companies emerged from amongst the bushes they formed



I



REMINISCENCES OF PRIVATE IVANOFF 335

up and opened out. A single cannon-shot thundered
out. They had fired a shell. The men started, and all
eyes were attracted by a white puff of smoke which was
already dispersing and slowly rolling down the hill. At
the same instant the screeching sound of a shell as it flew,
apparently directly, over our heads made everyone duck.
The shell, passing over us, struck the ground near the
companies in rear of us. I remember the dull thud of its
burst was followed by a pitiful cry from someone. A
splinter had torn off the company sergeant-major's foot.
I heard of this later. At the time I could not understand
the cry ; my ears heard it — that was all. Then everything
merged into that confused indescribable feeling which
takes possession of anyone coming under fire for the first
time. They say that there is no one who is not afraid in
action. Any modest and truthful man, to the question,
'* Were you frightened ?" replies, " Yes." But it is not
the physical fear which takes hold of a man at night, in
some obscure alley, when encountering a footpad. It is
the full, clear recognition of the inevitability and prox-
imity of death. And, fantastic and strange as these
words may appear, this recognition does not make men
stop, does not force them to think of flight, but compels
them to go ahead. Bloodthirsty instincts are not
awakened ; there is no desire to go ahead in order to kill
somebody. But there is an irresistible force which drives
one forward at all costs. Thoughts as to what must be
done during action cannot be expressed in words. It is
necessary to kill, or rather — one's duty to die.

Whilst we were crossing the valley the Turks succeeded
in firing several shots. As we slowly climbed up to the
village we were separated from the Turks only by the
last piece of thick undergrowth. As we entered the
bushes everything became quiet.

It was difficult going. The dense, often prickly, bushes
grew thickly, and it was necessary either to go round
them or to push one's way through them. The sharp-



336 REMINISCENCES OF PRIVATE IVANOFF

shooters in front of us were already extended, and from
time to time called gently to each other so as not to lose
touch. Up to the present the whole company was
together. A profound silence reigned in the wood.

Then there came the first rifle-shot, not very loud and
resembling the thud of a woodman's axe. The Turks
were beginning to fire at random. Bullets whistled high
above in the air in varying tones ; they flew noisily through
the bushes, cutting off branches, but were not touching
us. This noise like wood-chopping became more and
more frequent, and finally melted into an uniform tapping.
The squealing and snarling of single bullets could no
longer be heard. The very air itself seemed to be yelping.
We hurriedly advanced. I and all around me were whole.
This much astonished me.

Suddenly we emerged from the bushes. A deep gully
along which ran a little stream intersected the road. The
men halted a few minutes and drank.

From here the companies extended on either side so as
to outflank the Turks. Our company was left in reserve
in the gully. The skirmishers were to go direct
through the bushes and rush the village. The Turkish
fire was as frequent as formerly, unceasing, but much
louder.

Having climbed up to the other side of the gully,
Ventzel formed up his company. He said something to
the men which I did not hear.

" We will try, we will try !" resounded the voices of
the men.

I looked at him from below. He was pale, and it
seemed to me, sorrowful, but calm. Seeing Ivan Plato-
nich and Stebelkoff , he waved to them with his handker-
chief, and then looked towards us as if in search of some-
thing. I guessed that he wished to bid me fareweU, and
I stood up so that he should notice me. Ventzel smiled,
nodded his head several times at me, and ordered his men
to go up into the fire. The m.en extended right and left,



REMINISCENCES OF PRIVATE IVANOFF 337

forming a long line, and were at once lost to sight in the
bushes, with the exception of one man, who suddenly
bounded forward, threw up his hands, and feU heavily
to the ground. Two of ours jumped out of the gully and
brought in his body.

There was a torturing half-hour of suspense.

The fight developed. Rifle-fire became more frequent
and became one menacing howl. Guns boomed on our
right flank. Blood-bespattered men, some walking, some
crawling, commenced to appear from out of the bushes.
At first only a few, but their numbers increased every
moment. Our company assisted them down into the
gully, gave them water, and dressed their woimds waiting
the arrival of the stretcher-bearers. A rifleman with a
shattered wrist, crying out terribly and rolling his eyes,
his face pallid from loss of blood and pain, arrived by
himself and sat down by the stream. They tied up his
arm and placed him on his great coat. The bleeding
stopped. He was in a highly feverish state. His lips
trembled, and he was sobbing nervously and convul-
sively.

" Mates, mates ! . . . dear comrades !...'*

" Are many kiUed ?"

" Yes, they are falling."

" Is the company commander all right ?'*

*' Yes, as yet. But for him we would have been beaten
back. We wiU take it. With him they wiU take it,"
said the wounded man in a weak voice. " Three times
he led, and they beat us back. He led for the fourth
time. They (the Turks) are sitting in a gully. They have
heaps of ammunition, and go on firing and firing. . . .
But no !" the wounded man screamed suddenly, rising
and waving his injured hand. " You are joking, it
cannot be. . . . They must ..."

Then, rolling his delirious eyes and shouting out the
most awful curses, he fell forward senseless.

Lukin appeared on the bank of the gully.

22



33S REMINISCENCES OF PRIVATE IVANOFF

" Ivan Platonich !" he shouted out in an unnatural
voice, *' Bring them on !"

*****

Smoke, reports, groans, and a mad " hurrah." A
smell of blood and powder. . . . Strange men with pale
faces enveloped in smoke. ... A savage, monstrous,
inhuman struggle. Thank God that such moments are
remembered only as in a dream, mistily.

*****

When we reached them Ventzel had led the remnant
of his company for the fifth time at the Turks, who were
raining lead on him. This time the riflemen gained the
village. The few Turks still defending it succeeded in
getting away. (The second rifle company lost in the
two hours' fighting fifty- two men out of a little over one
hundred.) Our company, having taken but little part
in the action, lost only a few.

We did not remain on the position we had won, although
the Turks had been defeated all along the line. When
our General saw battalion after battalion take the road
out of the village, when he saw masses of cavalry move
off and long lines of guns, he was horrified. It was evident
the Turks did not know our strength, concealed by the
bushes. Had they known that only fourteen companies in
all had driven them out of the deep roads, gullies, and hedges
surrounding the village, they would have returned and an-
nihilated us. They were three times as many as ourselves. ^

By the evening we were back again at our old camp.
Ivan Platonich called me in to have some tea.

** Have you seen Ventzel ?" he asked.

" Not yet."

" Go to him. He is in his tent. Tell him we want him^
He is killing himself. ' Fifty- two ! fifty-two !' is aU yoi
can hear. Go to him."

A thin piece of candle was feebly illuminating Ventzel' J
tent. He was crouching in one of the comers with hisj
bowed head resting on some boxes, and sobbing bitterly.

THE ACTION AT AISLAR

I

We halted two weeks at Kovachitsa. Camp-life is
wearisome and monotonous when there is nothing to do,
especially in such an out-of-the-way spot ; at the same
time it would not be just to call Kovachitsa by such a
name. The staff of our corps had its quarters in the
place and there was a postal section — in a word, the
means of finding out what was going on in the world
surrounding us, but chiefly at the two theatres of war
and in our dear, far-away Homeland. However, it must
be said in all justice that we were not spoiled by the
freshness and wealth of the news, and it often appeared
to us to be mutilated and exaggerated. Sombre rumours
of the early failures at Plevna were so exaggerated that
only papers two or three weeks old dispersed the gloom
reigning amongst the officers. It seemed that the direct
road from Plevna was not as close to us as the route via
Petersburg and Moscow ; however, " the shortest cut is
the longest way round," as the saying goes.

Our brigade began to get bored. It is true that once
a portion of the Niejinsky Regiment went out recon-
noitring, or, more correctly speaking, to punish the armed
inhabitants of Lom, who had risen. Having taught them a
lesson, the regiment returned with the loss of one killed.
Another soldier escaped by a miracle, as will be seen from
the following narrative of his :

339



340 THE ACTION AT AISLAR

" We had begun to turn back, and the Bashi-Bazouks
commenced to fire from afar. I lagged behind a little, and
turned to fire. I had only just started to overtake them
when it hit me in the back. But it was a bad shot — it
buried itself in my great-coat. It went through seven
folds and stuck in the eighth."

*' It '* was, of course, a bullet. When the soldier opened
out his great-coat there were actually seven holes in it.

" And I had only time to cross myself when — look ! —
my ration-bag had two holes in the very bottom of it, and
biscuit crumbs began to dribble out."

It had a bite of them and went.

*' Our Russian biscuits are not tasty," said somebody
jokingly.

Meanwhile, whilst we were halted in Kovachitsa, and, to
use the popular expression, " were going sour," there were
constant skirmishes ahead of us at the front, near Papkio.

On the gth of August our regimental doctor ordered a
" medical inspection " to assemble in the lines of the third
battalion (which was camped apart from us) . Our company
was the first of all to muster, and after they had formed
us up, we were marched to the appointed parade-ground.
It was not a large piece of ground, but was free of tents
and guns. Here we halted. There was no doctor, and
we were obliged to wait for him. Having nothing to do
I began to gaze at the camp. A camp in time of war
presents a strange appearance. The little tents of the
soldiers shone brightly white bathed in sunshine. The
piles of arms and different coloured figures of soldiers
lent a variety to this white background. Lilac-coloured
shirts predominated ; then came red, yellow, crimson, and
green. The black tunics were only worn if on some duty.
Everyone preferred the most immoderate deshabille.
Some were bare-footed, others with bared chest and
back. Boots were not worn because of the heat, besides
which a thousand versts' march had taught the men the
necessity of taking care of them.



THE ACTION AT AISLAR 341

We waited quite a time. Someone went to inform the
doctor that the men were on parade. But it became
evident to us that we were not to undergo a " medical
inspection." The regimental Adjutant rushed into the
tent of the commandant of the third battalion, and
almost instantaneously stout little Major A. ran out
of his tent nearly naked, having divested himself of
most of his clothing owing to the heat, and gave the
order :

*' Third battalion, strike tents ! Leave knapsacks
behind." He then disappeared into his tent, which was
immediately struck, revealing the Major sitting on a
folding-chair and being assisted into various necessary
articles of clothing by his servant. At the same time there
was an immediate change in the appearance of the third
battalion. Men came crawling out of every tent like
ants, hurriedly putting on their uniforms. Tents dis-
appeared and were folded up, and great-coats were rolled.
Within five minutes of the Major's command, the
variegated, quiet bivouac had become transformed into
regular sombre-coloured ranks of men. Here and there
the sunlight played on the bayonets and rifle-barrels.
Officers came running towards the battalion fastening
on their sword-belts as they ran. The Major himself
appeared before the battalion, mounted his horse with
outside assistance, and gave a command, which was taken
up by the company commanders. The mass of humanity
stirred, and began, snakelike to draw out into column,
of route. Where was it going ? The Major, having led
the way on to the road, turned to the left and took the
column towards Papkio. The battalion had not had
time to get on to the road before our own orderly ap-
peared.

" Kuzma Zakharich, call up the company ; we are ad-
vancing."

" Without knapsacks ?" asked a number of voices at
once.



342 THE ACTION AT AISLAR

The question was one of the premier importance.
Nearly one-third of all a soldier's discomforts during a
campaign arise from the ** calf," as the soldiers nick-
named their clumsy knapsack. Others called it a " chest
of drawers." This " chest of drawers " hurts the
shoulders, presses on the chest, tires out the feet, and
lessens the stability of the body. Even in cool, fresh
weather it makes the back under it wet with perspiration
after five minutes' marching. It is not, therefore, aston-
ishing that the order to leave knapsacks behind was met
with general satisfaction.

The company ran to its bivouac. Everyone had already
assembled. Knapsacks were thrown into a heap and
tents struck. We hurriedly dressed. However much the
Russian may like to make a noise on every convenient
occasion and when he is in a crowd, there was absolute
silence. I have always been struck with this quietness
during the mustering of the men whenever the ** alarm "
sounded.

In a quarter of an hour's time we moved off. The
total distance from Kovachitsa to Papkio is from nine
to ten versts, but although we marched " light," without^
knapsacks and only with our great-coats slung bandolier-
fashion across our shoulders with our tent-sheets wrapped
up in them, these ten versts absolutely knocked us out.
The heat was deadly, over 35° Reamur in the shade, and
not the slightest vestige of a breeze. Everything seemed
to have died. The maize did not move its dark-green
leaves. The boughs and leaves of the pear-trees which
we passed were motionless. Not a solitary bird did we
see during the whole of this march. The men were done
even after the first four versts. When half way a halt
was called at a well, they were scarcely able to pile arms,
and literally fell on to the ground.

" Have you got out of the way of marching, Gabriel
Vassilivich ?" I said to my neighbour, as he lay with half-
closed eyes breathing heavily.



THE ACTION AT AISLAR 343

*' Yes, if one doesn't walk for a fortnight it spoils one/'
he answered dully. " Let us go for a drink."

We rose, and went to push our w^ay to the well, or, more
correctly speaking, to the spring. From an iron pipe
placed in the wall of stone at about the height of a man
a clear transparent stream ran into a stone trough.
The men pressed each other as they got the water, and
soaked each other as they passed their canteens full of
water over the heads of their neighbours. We had a good
drink and filled our water-bottles.

" Well, that's a bit better. I can manage another
march now," said Gabriel Vassihvich, wiping his fair
moustaches and beard with his sleeve.

He was an extraordinarily good-looking fellow, sturdy,
active, with big blue eyes. He now lies on the Aislar heights
and nothing is left of his blue eyes and handsome face.

Having given us a half-hour's spell. Major F. led us
further. The nearer we approached Papkio the more and
more difficult it became. The sun baked us with such fury
that it seemed as if it was hurrying to complete the job
before we reached our destination and could take refuge
from its heat in our tents. Some of us succumbed.
Scarcely moving along, with my head lowered, I almost
tripped over an officer who had fallen. He was lying,
scarlet in the face and was breathing convulsively and
heavily. They placed him in an ambulance-waggon.

The one and a half verst climb out of the valley along
which we had marched up its right slope seemed to us the
worst part of the whole road. The smells which always
notified us of any approaching camp added still further
to the suffocating heat. How I " stuck " it I absolutely
don't remember, but nevertheless I did. Others were less
fortunate. Scarcely able to drag one foot after another
we got into the order in which we were to camp, and,
barely able to stand up, awaited the longed-for command
from Major F. — " Pile arms !" That is, pile arms and do
what you like afterwards.



344 THE ACTION AT AISLAR

II

The men were so worn out that even the insufferable
heat could not make them go for water. Only after half
an hour's rest did the orderlies assemble with their can-
teens and set off for the village. On that slope of the
valley, on the summit of which we were encamped, was the
Mussulman quarter of Papkio — literally deserted since
the plague. On the opposite side crowded the Bulgarian
kishtas, precisely similar to the Turkish houses, with
exactly the same squat tiled roofs. There could be
heard the barking of dogs. People could be seen, also
sheep and buffaloes, or " bufflos," as our men called them.
To the right was the valley along which we had just come,
with a stream in the middle and endless fields of maize,
barley, and wheat along its slopes. To the left, at right
angles to our valley, was the valley of Lom, fading away
on either side into a misty bluish distance, out of which
the mountains on the right bank of the river could be seen
with decreasing clearness.

Opposite us these heights rose to a great elevation. At one
point on them there appeared at intervals a puff of white
smoke which, slowly and slowly drifting, melted and dis-
appeared, fused in the air. Half a minute later there
Vv'ould come a dull roar resembling the growl of distant
thunder. This was the Morshansk Regiment carrying out
a reconnaissance.

We found the springs, got some water, and returned
in no particular order to our bivouac. The soldiers,
having rested a little, were already more lively. The
distant firing undoubtedly helped in this matter.

" Listen ! What firing !"

" What do you think, chums ? Are they ours or the
Turks ?" asked someone.

Somebody else replied that the Morshansk Regiment had
taken no guns with them, and certainly, judging from the
situation and direction of the smoke, they could not be
shots from our guns.



THE ACTION AT AISLAR 345

More to the right of the village, much nearer than the
shell-fire, not on the heights, but below it in the Valley of
Lorn, began the sound of rifle-fire, at first desultory, as
if several axes were hewing down trees, then more and
more often. Sometimes the sound united in a prolonged
crackle.

I went up to the officers of our company. Our com-
pany commander was talking to another officer — S. —
telling him that he had just been informed that similar
'* brushes " took place here almost every day.

" Well, it seems we have got into action at last," said S.

" But what sort of action is this ? . . . Surely you
cannot call this an action ? Some of the local inhabitants
have squatted down with their blunderbusses in the woods
and are sniping us. All the same, stray bullets may come
this way, and I should not like to be killed in such a way."

" Why, Ivan Nicolaievitch ?" I asked.

" Because what sort of action is this ?"

Ivan Nicolaievitch was an expert on military matters
and a tremendous admirer of strategy and tactics. He
frequently expressed the opinion that if he was to be
killed it ought to be done in the proper manner in a
proper battle, or, better still, in a general action. The
present skirmishing was evidently not to his liking. He
tugged uneasily at a few straggling hairs on his chin, then
suddenly with a good-humoured and serious smile ex-
claimed :

" Better to come along and have some tea ; the samovar
is ready."

We crawled into the tent, and settled down to drink
tea. Little by little the firing died down, and we spent
the remainder of the day and night in absolute quietness.

By the way, I dreamt all night long of white puffs of
smoke and of the rattle of musketry.

When I awoke the sun was already high up. The heat
was like yesterday's. A battalion of the Nevsky Regi-
ment which had passed us going in the direction of



346 THE ACTION AT AISLAR

yesterday's cannonading marched along, however, quite
spiritedly. The men were infected with the closeness of
battle.

However, they soon returned, and, skirting the village,
probably made for the scene of the previous day's rifie-
iiring. To-day it was less distinct, the shots were further
from us. The guns, too, roared at first from our side,
but soon white puffs of smoke showed themselves on the
heights of the opposite bank. The Turks had brought up
some artillery.

I proposed to S. going into the village to climb on to
some roof and follow the fight. One could see better
from this position. Although the minaret was untouched,
and of course stood high above any roof, the mosque
itself stood low down, almost in the valley, so we clam-
bered on to the gallery of the first Cherkess house we came
to which happened to face towards the scene of the
action. But although it lay before us, we could see no
troops or even any rifles-moke. There was simply nothing
to be seen. We slid down from the gallery into a little
garden of white acacias and apricot trees. Everything
was in perfect order, as if it was only yesterday the
owners had watered the flower-beds. Pumpkins were
winding their clinging stalks along the hedge, whilst a
few stalks of maize and high " rat's-tails " with red ears
gave colour to the garden. We entered the house. The
walls were smoothly and clearly plastered with a grey
clay. All was in perfect repair. Only the hearth, made
of pieces of tile, was broken. On the floor were scat-
tered a few leaves of some Mussulman book with decorated
headings in gold and paint.

There was nothing more to see, and climbing over the
labyrinth of hedges we got out into the street. Here we
met S.'s servant, who came running towards us, red as a
lobster.

" Please, sir, please ! They have already stood to
arms !"



THE ACTION AT AISLAR 347

We ran to the battalion, and in two minutes' time I, too,
was marching along with my rifle shouldered.

We went towards the scene of yesterday's rifle skirmish.
The soldiers began to cross themselves. A long string
of ambulance waggons halted on the road to let us pass
and followed on behind us.

Ill

We skirted round the village, descended, and passed
over a small bridge throv/n across the stream. The road
led lightly to the mountain through a small thicket.
Little medlar-trees, all red from the quantity of fruit,
mingled with blackthorn. It was a narrow road, and
not more than four men could march abreast. To the
right of it gun and rifle pits had been dug out amongst
the bushes, preparations in case of an attack by the Turks
on Papkio.

We halted and allowed some regiment to pass us. It
was the Nevsky Regiment, which had been under fire all
day and was now returning to camp, as it had expended
all its ammunition. So far as I can remember, its
casualties that day had not been great. They marched as
if worn out and tired, but with an air of gaiety and good
spirits.

" What are you coming back for, mates ?" we asked
them. Some of them said nothing, but merely opened
their empty cartridge pouches. Others replied that there
were no more cartridges, that the Sofia Regiment, which
was in front, had relieved them, and that the Turks had
fallen back.

" Oh you !"

" Why ' Oh you ' ? You go yourself two days without
food. Besides, there are no cartridges. A soldier without
cartridges is like a pipe without tobacco," said one of the
Nevsky 's, knocking out his pipe. " Turn back ? Yes
if they came at us, but when it is a case of they firing and
we firing, there's nothing in it. Chum, give me a draw."



348 THE ACTION AT AISLAR

He had a puff or two, and then ran to catch up his
company.

A battery came trotting past, and we followed behind
it. The sun was setting and was gilding everything.
We went down into a ravine where a small stream was
flowing. Ten gigantic black poplars hid the spot like a
roof where we again halted. The ambulance waggons
were drawn up in several rows. The doctors, dressers,
and hospital orderlies were hurrying about and making
preparations for bandaging. The guns were booming not
far away, and became ever increasingly frequent.

Two more battalions passed us. Evidently we had been
left in reserve. We were led to one side, piled arms, and
laid down on ground which was covered with soft, fragrant
smelling mint.

I lay on my back and gazed through the branches at
the darkening sky. The giant trunks, which would have
required some half-dozen men to span their girth, had
shot up and thrown out branches which had interlaced
with each other. Only here and there could there be
seen a little star in the now blue-black sky, and far, far
away they seemed, as if in the depth of some abyss from
which they were peacefully grazing. The booming of
guns continued, and the tops of the trees momentarily
reflected the red glare which appeared immediately before
each report, making them look even more terrible and
dismal. There was no sound of rifle-fire. Probably it
was what is known in military parlance as an artillery
preparation for an attack.

I lay there half dozing ; around me the men were talking
quietly and with restraint. I remember now a curious
circumstance which at the time did not occur to me.
No one, by so much as a word, hinted at or recalled the
fact that there was another world for him, with home,
relatives, and friends. All appeared to have forgotten
their former life. They talked about this menacing boom
of cannon, why the Nevsky Regiment had gone back, and



THE ACTION AT AISLAR 349

why they had not had ammunition brought them. They
conjectured on the strength of the Turks, and what of our
force was engaged. Was it only the three regiments
(Nevsky, Sofia, and Bolkhovs), or both divisions ?

" But perhaps the Eleventh Brigade will be in time
also. We'll give it hot to them."

*' Don't say that. Who can tell ? Perhaps they have
brought all their strength. If only we can hold them it
will be all right. They will not ask more from us."

" Yes, that's right. Besides, they say we are not
allowed to attack."

*' Who told you that ?"

" Ivanoff, the staff -clerk. He is a countryman of mine."

" How can your Ivanoff know ?" said the man doubt-
fully.

The tops of the poplars commenced to pale and the
leaves took on a silvery hue as they softly reflected the
moonlight. The moon had risen, but we could not see
it, as we were lying at the bottom of the ravine. Never-
theless, it became a little lighter. A mounted officer
showed up on the brink of the ravine and shouted des-
pairingly : " Send forward the cartridge boxes of the
Sofia Regiment." But the boxes were on the opposite
side of the ravine, and in spite of all his shouting his voice
did not carry to the ammunition carts. One of our
officers called out, " Pass the word along." Whereupon
there commenced something in the nature of what musi-
cians call a fugue. Somebody shouted " Cartridges boxes
forward !" another began the same phrase as the first
called out " boxes," and a third took it up when the
second finished " cartridges." At any rate the slumber-
ing ammunition carriers woke up, and, putting their
horses at the gallop, crossed over the ravine.

In ten minutes' time musketry fire commenced. The
ear, which at first had listened painfully to each shot,
grew tired. Moreover, sleep was calling. Soon the shots
became one confused roar, somewhat resembling the



350 THE ACTION AT AISLAR

noise of a waterfall ; then it, too, died down. I dropped
asleep.

" Rise !"

The voice of our battalion commander awoke me. All
got up, stretched themselves, and threw their great-
coats, which had but just served as pillows, over their
shoulders.

'' Take up arms !" The guns had not ceased firing.
We clambered out of the ravine, and went along a wide
road made by the artillery. The flashes of the shots were
already nearer, and their sounds became unpleasantly
loud. Immediately following the flash, which pierced the
air like a needle, came a thunderous roar, after which
something rang as it cut its way through the air. These
were our shells, which were flying towards the gloomy
precipitous heights occupied by the Turks. The gunners
worked their guns silently, keeping up a continuous fire.
Sometimes two guns united their roar, and two shells
flew simultaneously, bursting on the slope of the mountain,
right in the Turkish firing-line.

We continued to advance. It was two versts to the
summit. The even and wide road had come to an end,
and we entered a straggling wood all overgrown with
bushes. It was difficult work, especially in the darkness,
making our way through the gorse and bushes, but the
men conscientiously kept their dressing. Some large
stone slabs placed end up came into view. It was a
Mussulman cemetery, in which were real Mahometan
monuments — stones roughly hewn at the top in the form
of a turban. Here we halted.

The moon lit up strongly the mountain behind which
the battle was raging. At the foot of the mountain was
a line of flashes — our firing-line — and above it another
and thicker line — the Turkish firing-line. These lines
kept intermingling. The Sofia Regiment was attacking.
The upper flashes kept showing up higher and higher and
farther and farther away. But we could not follow the



THE ACTION AT AISLAR 351

fight very long because they led us ofi somewhere to the
flank and posted each company separately. From these
points we could once more see the little flashes of flame,
and the sound of these shots, as of something blunt and
wooden, fell without ceasing on our ears. But soon it
was more than sounds which reached us.

" S-s-s . . . s-s-s . . . s-s-s ..." resounded in the air
above us, left and right.

" Bullets !" cried someone.

" All right ! Lie down. . . . They have come to die
here."

It was quite true, the bullets w^ere already spent, as can
always be told by their sound. A bullet when fired at
close range squeals and whistles, but when it '* comes to
die " merely hisses like a snake.

The bullets continued to fly around us. The company
kept silent. The tense feeling which involuntarily
showed itself at the sound of these heralds of death
relaxed. All began to imagine that the bullets were
merely flying over us or dropping harmlessly to earth.
Some of the men, having taken off their great-coats,
settled themselves down to sleep more comfortably, if
it is possible to sleep comfortably under a shower of
bullets, on ruts of dried mud, and holding a rifle in one's
hands. I, too, dozed. It was a heavy, torturing slumber.
Not far from us — I think in the 7th company — there
was a sudden commotion. " Take him away," I heard.
** Where can we take him ? . . ." broke in someone. I did
not hear the end of the remark. Ivan Nicolaievitch sent
to find out what had happened. It appeared that a
bullet which had " come to die " did not wish to die alone,
and had actually buried itself in the heart of a soldier.
This death caused a painful depressing impression. To
be killed without seeing the enemy by a bullet w^hich has
travelled three thousand paces (two versts) seemed to
all as something fateful, awful. However, little by little
all became quiet, the men calmed down again, and began



352 THE ACTION AT AISLAR

to doze. A not loud, harsh sound awoke everyone. A
bullet had gone clean through the side of the big drum.
Somebody was found even to make a joke about it, which
met, however, with general disapproval. " This is no
time to play the fool," growled the men.

Everyone was rather on the alert, everyone was waiting
for something. A bullet found its way into the cartridge
pouch of one of the men, who, pale and trembling, carried
it off to show the company commander. Ivan Nico-
laievitch examined the bullet attentively, and noting from
its calibre that it had been fired from a Peabody and
Martini rifle, moved the company into a kind of bend in
the road.

Here we, notwithstanding the whistling and hissing,
became calmer. Shouts of " Hurrah !" resounded on
the mountain. It was the Sofia Regiment storming the
position.

IV

I aw^oke when it was still almost dark. My sides ached
unendurably. The bullets were flying as before, but now-
very high in the air above us. There were no flashes to
be seen on the mountain, but a frequent cannonade could
be heard. " It means that the mountain has been taken
and the Sofia Regiment is holding the crest," I reflected.

The sun had scarcely risen when they roused us. The
men got up, yawning and stretching themselves. It was
cold. The majority of us were shivering and shaking as
if in a fever. The companies mustered at the spring,
and both our battalions (2nd and 3rd) moved off towards
the mountain.

Immediately after crossing the Lom by a small bridge
the road led up the mountain. At first the ascent, al-
though all covered with bushes, was bearable, but the
higher we got the steeper became the slope and the
narrower the road. Finally we were compelled to
clamber up one by one, sometimes helping ourselves up

with our rifles. The companies got mixed together with
officers of another battalion ; our Colonel appeared
amongst us, having clambered with difficulty on to the
heights. " What a brute of a mountain !'' he exclaimed
to his Adjutant. *' How did the Sofia Regiment manage
to take it ?"

'* It was difficult, sir," said some tiny little soldier of
the 8th company.

The Sofia Regiment came down as we went forward to
relieve them. Worn out by a sleepless night, by thirst
and nervous excitement, they were somewhat unstrung,
and made no reply to our questions as to whether there
were many Turks and whether the fire was hot. Only a
few said quietly, " God help you !"

At length we got to the summit of the mountain. At
the last the ascent lay up an absolutely overhanging crag.
Beneath it was a small ledge where the companies could
reform without danger from the fire. Although the
difficult ascent, the bushes, and the narrow track had
absolutely mixed us up, the men re-formed and fell into
their proper places extraordinarily quickly. The bullets
as they flew past the ledge caterwauled above us in a
piercing and extremely unpleasant manner. Here be-
neath the crag it was safe, but what was it like on it ?
Branches of the bushes growing on the crest cracked as
they were smashed by the bullets, sometimes a few leaves
came twirling do\\Ti. We moved to the right, at first
under the ledge, then little by little began to clamber up
one by one from boulder to boulder. Having got round
the crag, we crawled out on to the extreme summit and
moved between the dense high bushes. I don't know
who was leading us. All moved in the direction of the
firing, pushing along with difficulty between the bushes.
At last we came upon a narrow track. "Forward!
Double ! " Here there were lying fresh corpses, both of
ours and of Turks. The wounded were already being
carried along toward us. The little man of the 8th

company who had so boldly entered into conversation
with the regimental Colonel was now half delirious, wail-
ing pitifully, and with one hand supporting the other,
from which a stream of blood was flowing. We con-
tinued to rush forw^ard, and at length arrived at an open
space. emt llti e Major F. was already there, walking
unconcedly up and down the firing-line. " Where
shall I go. Major ?" I asked. He made no reply, but
pointed to the left with his sword. I ran forward, throw-
ing myself once to the ground to avoid a bursting shell.
Ivan Nicolaievitch was slowly pacing up and down, tugging
at his straggly hairs.

" Ivan Nicolaievitch," I called out. " I don't know
where our half section is. May I join the first ?"

** Go along, go along quickly !" he said, looking beyond
at the Turkish line.

However, it was impossible to find either the first or
second half section. Everyone had become mixed up
in the wood, and it was too late to re-form under rifle and
shell fire. I laid down behind the first hillock I cam^e
across and began to fire. On one side of me I found our
corporal and on the other side a man of the Sofia Regi-
ment. ** You should have gone, chum," I said to him.
*' Your lot have gone — left this."

" Yes, but never mind, I shall stay until the end," he
replied. I do not know what his name was. I do not
even know whether he is still alive, but I shall always
remember the enthusiastic tone of his voice.

The Turkish sharpshooters were about eight hundred
paces from us, so that our rifles scarcely did them much
harm. Moreover, a whole row of Turkish guns were in posi-
tion from twelve hundred to fifteen hundred paces from us,
and raining shell on our weak firing-line. Although bullets
cause many more deaths and wounds, yet shells have a
far greater moral effect. I lay, firing at intervals, and
every now and then consulting Paul Ignatich (our corporal)
as to the sights and whether it would not be better to fire

on chance at the artillery. The bullets began to whistle
amongst us oftener and oftener. At last it became im-
possible to distinguish individual shots. It became one
continuous hum. Shells came flying along screaming
from afar. As they neared us they no longer screamed,
but crashed and bounded along the ground, bursting and
smothering us with splinters and earth. I raised myself
to see what was happening in our firing-line. From time
to time there arose a wild cry from amongst those lying
down. Those standing behind trees would fall on to their
knees sometimes with a cry, sometimes without a sound.
Gabriel Vassilich, who had only just arrived, and was
loading his rifle, fell headlong. A shell splinter had
struck him in the stomach, tearing out his vitals. Such
of the wounded as were able crawled away, for the most
part silently, or perhaps it was that their groans could
not be heard above the din of battle.

I began to shoot again. The Turks had collected
below the deep valley, on the other edge of which was
their artillery, and were advancing to attack our firing-
line. The range became closer. Paul Ignatiovich kept
methodically loading and firing. I, too, did not spare
my cartridges, because it was easy to take aim. Dark
figures with red heads coming towards us kept falling,
but they still advanced. Suddenly the red heads dis-
appeared. I do not know if it was the unevenness of
the ground or the bushes which hid the columns. Having
lost the near object at which to aim, I commenced once
more to fire at long range into the masses standing at the
bottom of the valley, and scarcely noticed that both Paul
Ignatich and the soldier of the Sofia Regiment and our
firing-line had disappeared. I turned round. The men
had collected in groups, and were pouring a hot fire into
the advancing Turks. I was alone between our men and
the Turkish column.

What was I to do ? This thought had scarcely flashed
into my head when I heard my name called out near me.



356 THE ACTION AT AISLAR

I looked down. At my feet lay Feodoroff, the young
soldier of our company who, having resided in St. Peters-
burg, had seized '* civilization," and could express himself
in an almost educated manner. Now he was lying white
as this sheet of paper. A torrent of blood was flowing
from his shoulder. "V. M., old man, give me a drink,
carry me off, take me away," he begged piteously. I
forgot everything — both Turks and bullets. For me to
lift sturdy Feodoroff unaided was out of the question, and
of ours there was no one, in spite of my despairing cries,
who could make up his mind to race even those thirty
paces to help.

Seeing an officer, the young subaltern S., I began to
call out to him : " Ivan Nicolaievitch, help ! No one will
come ! Help me !" Perhaps S. would have come, but a
bullet laid him low. I was almost crying. . . . Finally
two soldiers — I think of our company — rushed towards
me. We seized hold of Feodoroff, who continued cease-
lessly to cry out piteously, *' Take me away, old man, for
Christ's sake !" I took hold of his legs and the other
two his shoulders. At the same moment they dropped
him on to the ground. " The Turks, the Turks !" they
yelled, bolting. Feodoroff was dead. I turned round.
Twenty paces distant from me the Turkish column had
halted, surprised, and frightened of our bayonets. . . .

A minute later something like a huge stone struck me.
I fell. Blood was flowing like a stream from my leg.
I remember that I suddenly recalled everything — home,
relatives, and friends, and with joy reflected that I should
once more see them. . . .
